disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,23-Sep-20,Ann B,5,929,"These SUDILO Disposable Protective Black Masks are Attractive, Fit Well, and have a 3 ply filter. This mask can filter Haze, Dust, Carbinol, Spatter, and Stink.. It also has an adjustable nose clip, and very comfortable ear loops."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,30-Dec-20,Layla Simons,5,335,I work on an ambulance and we are required to always wear masks right now even when we don’t have patients. I wanted something thinner than an N-95 for non-patient care times and something more breathable but effective. We have regular surgical masks but the fibers are always tickling my nose so I ordered these. They are very breathable but thick enough that I would say they provide good protection. They look nice and the material holds up for multiples uses. There’s also no fibers tickling my nose. I definitely recommend these for just every day use during this pandemic whether you’re a healthcare provider or anyone else.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Sep-20,Lyn,5,333,"The black masks come in a box of 50 for your daily needs. They are disposable, but thick enough and well made to get more than one use from them. They fit well over your chin and they are adjustable for a snug fit over the nose, giving them a fog free fit for glasses when adjusted properly."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Sep-20,Darla Mae Bertelle,5,294,These masks are super easy to breath in. I like that they dont form close to your mouth. Definitely recommend these!
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Oct-20,Joseph Malinowski,5,194,"When I first bought masks in April I paid $10.00 for 10 masks. This price was wonderful. They are as comfortable as any other mask. I bought these for my kids and I. So no matter what, we have enough. I also love the color."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,17-Oct-20,dr awesome,5,188,"These do the job, have ordered two sets now for the pandemic. They do make your lips feel a little waxy but they are thick so I know I’m not sharing germs. Kids love the Black color instead of the blue so it’s worth it!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,12-Nov-20,squaits,5,262,"I had never used a disposable mask before, mostly because I hated the look of the blue ones and because they are not environmentally friendly. However, I needed to purchase a breathable, disposable mask to wear for an extended period of time and was delighted to find an all-black option. This mask is very comfortable, lightweight, and easily stretches to fit my large head. Typically masks pull on my ears or are too tight around my mouth, but this easily fit around my face and left plenty of room to open fully. The fact that it is such a large pack of masks is great, because I will be stocked up for a long time. I even shared some with family who I thought could use a more fashionable option. I would definitely recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a better option than the standard medical blue masks."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,18-Dec-20,Alex Chaney,5,246,"I have to wear a mask at work and was tired of the blue medical look so I ordered these black ones.  These are multilayered masks, I have cut one open to see, with a finer screen in between the two more open pieces. Pros: Wire insert in nose piece.  That helps cut down on my glasses fogging. I can get free masks at work but they use a plastic insert and my glasses fog terribly when I try that mask. The mask is has been a good quality.  I have been trough most of a box with no ear loop failures. It is a layered mask which is required where I work. Not blue Cons:  I need a larger mask and I haven't found one yet in any brand.  At the end of the day I am beyond ready to take it off because of the tugging on my ears.  I will often use a mask keeper to hold the mask instead of using the ear loops on my ears. I have a few boxes of other masks that i have purchased because of the price but I would buy these again at 3-4x the price."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,1,18,"Mask is lightweight and comfortable if you are using it for a day or less. Also if you don’t touch it too much or keep having to take it off and putting it back on several times during the day. If you’re like me and need to be putting the mask on and taking it off several times during the day, you will notice that it starts to deteriorate after a few hours of usage. After wearing it for a bit, the quality starts to worsen and little clothing fibers start to lift from the mask which makes it extremely itchy and uncomfortable. Additionally, the bands are not too stretchy; they rip break/rip way too easily. The good thing is that it’s easy to tie a knot and repair the band. My head is usually smaller than the average persons so the fact that it rips so easy should be concerning for people with bigger heads."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Dec-20,Linda Horseman,1,19,Purchased based on the good reviews. These masks have very small loose fibers that feel like there is a hair in your nose.  I only wear disposable masks and have purchased different brands. These are the first that have had this issue.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Jan-21,Jessgeee,1,14,"This mask is sleek and nice . Better than wearing a blue disposable mask ,but it Sheds to much on the outside and you can it feel it inside your nose. The material making your nose itchy . Save your money and buy them somewhere else"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Jan-21,Ivan,1,11,These masks are by far the worst I’ve had. The masks arrived with a strong chemical smell like burnt plastic. I was suspicious and after just a couple of wears my face started breaking out in a rash and I’ve never experienced anything like it. I’m afraid to wear them now. The material is also very thin and the woven material started falling apart on the first wear. The one nice thing about them is that they cover a good amount of face but I wouldn’t recommend them after my purchase.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,7-Feb-21,Ella,1,11,"Loved this mask at first. I’m always wearing black so I felt like this was a must have. Also disposable masks are a tad bit easier to breath in so I said win win. After a week of wearing them I started to notice my breathing was acting a little weird.. the only new thing was the mask since I needed it for work. I’m not 100% sure what they use to make these masks but something ain’t right. Went back to my normal mask and I felt better In just one day of not wearing these disposable masks. Also quick note , I often wore the regular blue disposable masks and I never had an issue till I tried these. I know a lot of people who still wear them , maybe I was just allergic to something in it but I don’t personally recommend."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Jan-21,Angela,1,11,"This mask is comfortable around the ears and fits well however it ends up with ""fuzzies"" on the inside and you constantly feel like you have to remove something from your lips/mouth area. Won't buy this kind again.  Also the straps break easily. These are Garbage."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,26-Dec-20,Adam,1,9,I have broken like 10 of these in 2 days. I am not even kidding. The ear loops have terrible connection to the mask itself. Lie its being help with freaking stick glue lol. Try a dif brand if I were you.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Jan-21,Jacob Sanchez,1,9,"Appearance and style is a 5 star, presentation is really good, but the quality would be Zero stars if i could leave that! The very first one i put on lasted literally 5 minutes, at first it felt great, but as soon as i went to adjust it, and lightly i might add, it popped very easy, so i thought maybe a put on a defective one, so i put on the second one... boom popped in a few minutes again. The third one lasted little longer over an hour, i was like ""forget it"". VERY POOR QUALITY! Don't waste your money. WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Feb-21,Chris Fullerton,1,7,"Not what you see in the picture. Single ply, will make your glasses fog up and THEY SMELL LIKE PAINT. Wore one of these for a full day and began to get nauseous. Amazon should pull this product from their site. Most likely carcinogenic and made in China. On the other hand, you might get a little head high from the paint fumes that they dyed them with, so if that's a plus, might want to buy these!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Oct-20,DM decor,2,11,"Very disappointed with these mask! They arrived in a beat up box, the packaging was broken and they are super THIN!!! Don’t bother ordering these! I trash them IMMEDIATELY!!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Nov-20,Cricut crafter,5,231,"These masks are super comfortable to wear. I like the black because it doesn’t get discolored from my makeup. Also doesn’t rub all of my makeup off, just very little. Also my face doesn’t get steamy and feel moist after wearing for long periods, worn for up to 10 hours at work. I like the throw away masks because they seem cleaner than reusable masks that probably aren’t washed often enough. I like to put a stack of these masks in my car and have in case someone in my family forgets their mask at home. Definitely would recommend!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Dec-20,Sherndina Moreland,3,8,"This mask has a chemical order, very off putting. I do like the black color. As comfortable behind ears, as the blue stretchy mask everyone is wearing, but the material is somewhat stiff. I placed  them on hangers in the garage to air out...still smell the oder  in my room, where I opened the box. Will not order again due to chemical smell and stiffness of material.  Small note inside said manufactured in China."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Jan-21,My Aun Lia,2,6,"Firstly, I purchased theses masks because I wanted disposable black masks. I use the standard blue on a daily basis but I wanted black to stand out a bit. The masks are relatively nice, generally... but the material becomes fuzzy very quickly. It was worn just during daily routine but the fuzz from the material continually irritated my nose and mouth. I got another mask and it did the same thing almost instantly, another mask and same problem.... Basically, the moment a new mask is opened and stretched to place on your face the material instantly becomes looser and fuzzes. Its as if the mask material is missing a layer of protectant over the fabric. I do not recommend these masks to wear for longer than 20 minutes maximum because if you remove the mask and return it to your face the material becomes unbearable. Because of that, I do not recommend and I would not order again."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Dec-20,Pa3cya,1,7,This is falsely described. This is most definitely 1 ply. I bought this black one and a box of 50 purple masks from a different company together. Right away I saw the box with the purple masks is much bigger. Right away I can feel that the black mask was like a cheap paper napkin. Then I decided to try it on and I could see through it. Returned it right away.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Nov-20,Kawaiimami,1,6,I’ve bought every kind on face mask/ shield possible since the pandemic started. These particular ones are the worst. Not only are the really big and uncomfortable. It literally had this weird scent. Not strong but still every time I breathed I would smell it. The first one I pulled out of the bag broke (explains why they give so many) also after wearing all day my ears were hurting. It was so big there is gaping in the side of my face . I also never had trouble breathing comfortably in other masks but this one made my face feel hot. One star for the black color.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,26-Dec-20,Yuval Romer,1,8,Look good but Not good quality. The inner lining comes apart and becomes like fuzz and is uncomfortable to breathe. Lining comes off and the fuzz goes into nose And mouth: it is also itchy
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Nov-20,Ray,4,7,The product is ok but not worth the extra money. I ordered the box of 50 mask. I’ve used about 20 of them. The face covering its self works as described. My issue is with the straps. Out of the 20 mask that I’ve used. The straps broke on 8 of them within the first couple of hours using them. I like most people spend the extra money thinking they were of better quality. They’re not.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Nov-20,Dani O,5,15,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on masks since the covid pandemic started. Shopped Etsy, facebook ads, instagram ads and online search ads. I have severe ""mask Claustrophobia"", yep I guess it's a thing due to lack of breathability. These highly affordable masks are the best I have bought and affordable. You can breath in air easily and they still pass the not being able to blow out a candle hack which means they are protecting you. This is the only mask I will use from now on. Fit myself and husband. Would be to big for a child in my opinion. Hope this helps anymore who was having the same problem as myself of not being able to breath in your mask."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Oct-20,Anna,2,7,"I purchased these masks because I got tired of wearing blue masks. I purchased these masks specifically because they are black. I was pleasantly surprised. They are thick, and the elastic does not break like some of the other.  They are actually great quality and very complimenting when you want more than just the hospital blue masks. They are also very thick and appears to be great for protection. Highly recommend these. ***originally rated this a 5 but not changing it to a 2 since a couple of them the string broke. I will be returning.***"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Oct-20,Jon,1,8,"These masks are way overpriced for the quality you get, they are very uncomfortable and the elastic strap breaks very easily, making it so you need to carry multiple masks just in case. This is a 5 dollar box of masks that are 3x the price they should be, due simply to demand. Get another brand of black mask!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,5,"In the photo it looks as though these have the soft, breathable comfy white inner lining. They do not! The same waxy black material is on both sides. For this reason alone they are uncomfortable & less breathable. Worse still, they have a bad smell, like whatever plastic or glues used to make them are still off-gassing. I work in an industry where we're careful about exposing ourselves to chemicals, and this is a chemical smell of some kind possibly containing VOCs. the worst thing you could breathe through all day.  DO NOT BUY"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Feb-21,IG,1,2,"I realize the item description says ""disposable"" but that usually means when you are done wearing it at the end of the day. The slightest movement of the mask, such as lifting it to get a drink of water, not to mention if you remove it to eat, causes the strap to become dislodged. Unless you have an extra in your pocket you must hold the mask to your face until you can obtain a replacement. After the first time it happened I became very cautious with any movement while using these masks. It has happened several more times no matter how careful I was. If you do not plan on moving it for any reason during the entire time you are wearing it the mask will meet your needs. However, if you need to remove it, or even just lift it partially off you face, make sure you have access to a replacement mask. I have used other masks and never experienced this repeated problem."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Dec-20,Alyse,3,3,"Although in terms of comfort, light weight and stretch parameters, this mask has five stars in all, it’s not an efficient mask for Covid purposes. It has pretty much no filter and all it really does is prevent the spread of any liquids such as sneezing or coughing particles. It’s pretty thin like any standard complimentary mask that you might get if you go into a airport or supermarket. The mask isn’t double lined so there’s not a thicker inside portion where you clearly are meant to put it against your mouth because it can prevent anything from outside sleeping in. If you’re looking for a mask that has a good filter and will actually prevent the small air particles that the virus can actually travel through, I recommend an N95. The mask is pretty much reversible whereas if you flip it inside out it’s gonna look the same and that’s not really what I was expecting from this but, I also bought it just because I like the color and wanted black masks."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Dec-20,Kristie,2,3,"I was shopping for disposable black mask. I thought I was getting a decent Black Friday deal. I ordered three boxes. They arrived in about week. The ear bands are soft and stretchy, overall the mask are comfortable for SHORT time use. However, these mask are falsely advertised, they definitely are not 3 ply! I wear glasses and bending the thin wire over my nose and trying to adjust the mask regular breathing still fogs up my glasses.  Also, after wearing a mask for a couple of hours it does become fuzzy on the inside. Which is super annoying. I'm not going to mess with returning them but I would not order again. I do not recommended this brand of mask."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,23-Feb-21,loren calevro,4,One,"Bought these masks to keep in my purse and car for all the times we forget to take a reusable masks with us or someone loses theirs. I like that they are black...since masks have pretty much become an ""accessory"" at this point. They just look ""nicer"" than the typical blue ones. They are comfortable, light weight, have the wire pinch nose and fit everyone in the house from my 13 year old son to my 41 year old husband. We all pretty much prefer them to our reusables. My boxes arrived in good condition and properly sealed. First time I pulled one out I thought ""man, this thing smells like pot!"" but maybe it was in my head....A While later my husband needed to use one and asked me "" is it just me or do these masks smell like pot?!"" So ok....not just in MY head. Then I went to a restaurant and our waitresses strap broke on her mask and I offered her one out of the sealed bag in my purse  and before we left she pulled me aside and said "" no judgement, but wanted to let you know that if you have pot in your purse it is making the masks smell like it!"" I bought two boxes and haven't opened the second yet to see if it's the same deal....but thought I would put it out there incase this is a regular thing and you wouldn't be down with people thinking you spend your days clam baking your masks!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,7-Feb-21,dsgyt,1,6,Was so excited to get these but even after airing them out for a couple of days- the chemical smell was super strong. Concerned about the toxicity of that smell right in your nasal cavity... no thanks.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Nov-20,Mac,1,5,"Every single mask has broken. The ear loops are held on by nothing apparently because EVERY ONE has broken. Either when I put it on or if I took it off and then put it back on, the second time it breaks. Ridiculous. Would not buy again."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,20-Dec-20,John H Wright,5,36,"Nice large size with a pretty sturdy metal wire for pinching against the top of your nose, so no threat of the masks falling and exposing the nose, which would defy the point of wearing one. Came with two huge packs within the box. Breathable material, and, if aesthetics are important to you, these black ones are comparatively attractive! Definitely nicer than the blue ones, and more hygienic than the stifling reusable cloth masks that everyone's aunt seems to be making these days. For whoever said the pleats go the wrong way....turn it around. Literally, just....flip the mask around lol. Not exactly rocket science. Considering the price, too, I would definitely recommend these, as long as you're not particularly petite, as they do provide a considerably larger coverage than many others I've seen."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Jan-21,David W. Fowell,5,49,"Finally, the first time I get a face mask that is very comfortable and the metal nose band works very well. I can breathe without fogging up my glasses or at least VERY little. They are very soft. Made from a (now get this) nonwoven, meltblown material, hows that! What ever it means it means it's soft and very comfortable and your face doesn't feel like it's in a sauna. In the description it isn't mentioned that the company rates their bacterial filtration efficiency greater than 95% and the company rates suitable for medical use, which I take it to mean medical offices. Very forthcoming I think. For what they appear to be ( unless told differently) getting fifty masks for what I was charged is a bargin. Yes I highly recommend them."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Feb-21,V. Sofia,1,3,"Yeah it is nice looking, comfortable and all that but the strings detach with minimal stretch to put on. My wife and I both has the same experience and no our heads are not large. I’ve never had a mask detach so easily from the strings that wrap around your ear. I had to tie one end around my glasses to keep it on at the doctors office. Look elsewhere."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Nov-20,Elio,1,3,"Update: These masks were so great that I ordered a second box. However, not one single mask had a nose piece in the right place. Some didn’t have any at all. I am really disappointed. Original: They stretch great. They're not too tight on the face, nose or ears. I wear these to the gym and honestly started wearing them wherever I go and have stopped using my other masks as soon as I tried these on. 10/10 would recommend."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,30-Nov-20,Kelly,5,12,"I had been wearing the traditional blue surgical face masks for several months, and after needing a new supply, decided to try these. These have a sturdier and thicker feel to them than the usual blue ones, and don't tear easy like I found that other type did. The most important part for me was how well they could perform when working out and breathing heavy. The regular blue masks would suck inwards towards the nose and mouth, leading to that dreaded panic attack feeling and like you can't get enough air. These masks fit well and stay put, without being sucked towards the face even during a rigorous workout on the treadmill. They haven't felt irritating, and I don't have to adjust them while wearing them even after a long while. I can breathe very freely and easily in them, and no more panicky feeling while wearing a mask!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,31-Jan-21,Bob,1,3,"The first mask I wore fell off while shopping at Costco. The ear loop detached. Luckily I had a pen with me and poked a hole where the loop attaches and fed it through and tied it off. When I got home I took the next mask from the box and with a slight tug the ear loop detached. It doesn't rip the material, it just comes off. I tried a 3rd mask and that one seems to be ok. I've not needed to dig further, and admit 3 masks is not a good statistical sample, but the first 2 out of 3 masks being defective is not a good sign. I will not buy again."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Dec-20,GVM,1,3,The biggest problem I have with these is that they sort of migrate around your face and you need to pull them back into place which is obviously not what you want. They also feel just slightly too small and a little itchy. Honestly we probably aren’t going to use them unless maybeeeee under another mask
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Dec-20,Daren F.,4,2,"I bought these because I hated the way the blue masks look. I like that the black goes well with everything and I don't look like I'm getting ready to perform a procedure anymore. I am giving 4 stars because the first set I got had a odd almost moldy smell so I contacted amazon and they were quick to send a replacement. The masks fits well and is easy to breathe in, material feels strong and it is not too rough on the skin. I will definitely be buying more of these."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Feb-21,Leanne,1,4,"These are AWFUL!! My face was SO itchy 😩 they are extremely linty and fuzzy...sonot feels like your fuzzes are going down your throat, which they actually are because when you breath in they do...Within minutes I had splotches all over my face and it felt puffy. My husband and kids had the same reaction. I thot black masks would be a better look then the blue medical ones but these are SO SO awful!!"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Nov-20,Marco Martinez,1,6,Okay mask if you’re only going in and out of the store quickly. Any longer and the inside fibers become frayed and essentially irritate your face. Might as well not have a mask on when every 30 seconds you have to take it off and rub your nose. Becomes unbearably itchy after about 30 minutes of use.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Dec-20,Kindle Customer,4,2,"Just got these. The color and quality great. The issue is I have a small sized face and they are too big. I can certainly use these over my cloth masks, I hope, or will use for guests. Another issue, my son has a wide face with a beard. These don't work that great for him either. Fits fine but as soon as he talks and moves his face, with his beard, they ride up his face. So these are definitely for an average  to larger face but careful for those with thicker beards."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Apr-21,kmurph31,5,,Basically this is one of the best purchases that I have ever made on Amazon.  There are fifty face masks that come in a box that are a one time wear and easy to dispose of.  It is a real bargain to receive 50 black masks for approximately thirteen dollars.  These masks can save your life by wearing them with a face shield that you can also purchase from Amazon for around the same price.  Wearing a face mask is not a political statement.  Wearing a mask can literally save your life and is the most effective way not to catch Covid19 besides being vaccinated.  I just got my one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine last Saturday.  I will continue to wear these affordable and effective face masks with my face shield until the whole USA is vaccinated.  The best bargain for your health that you can benefit for your money and your health.  Stay safe and buy these masks.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Dec-20,Niloc0,1,3,"These are straight up garbage. The elastic pulls out of the mask when trying to put them on, they break immediately Unusable. I've used other inexpensive disposable masks and they've been fine, avoid this brand."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Mar-21,M. D. Chambers,5,,"Over the last year I have been trying to find a facemask that would stand up to intense workouts, without success. Even masks supposedly designed for exercising fell short. If it wasn't sucking in the fabric while breathing heavy, then it was the bottom half of my face sitting in a pool of sweat with nowhere for it to go, or my glasses fogging up because the fit wasn't secure. Someone at my gym recommended these masks. This was money well spent.  The masks are lightweight, which helps most of the sweat evaporate quickly.  The fit is very secure over the bridge of my nose so no more fogged glasses. And the folds of the masks face outward so no more sucking in fabric while pushing through that last mile. I liked these so much that I've ordered 2 more boxes so I have a steady supply for the months to come. Highly recommended."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,31-Mar-21,Bob Fam,5,,"These have been the best go to masks for me through this pandemic. I can breath in them and they don’t make me look like I have bird beak. They are affordable! They are light weight, yet durable, breathable, doesn’t leave lines under my eyes to create wrinkles on my face, the position is adjustable at the nose to be high or lower on my face as I wish to wear it. Doesn’t pull tug or hurt my ears yet stays on and doesn’t fall or droop. I love the simplicity of the black color and the ear loops are black too so they match and it tends to match whatever I wear. They are disposable however they’re made well enough to use more than once, I get several wears out of one but there are many in a box so you can throw away as you feel you are exposed or need to dispose of them. My favorite go to mask of 2020-2021."
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,28-Jan-21,Mama Rosa,1,2,Product is not the same as shown in the website. Picture1: Product received from my order. Picture 2: My friend's home-made mask from Taiwan. Outer layer is the same material. Inner layer is cotton as an open pocket to insert or drape-over another disposable protection sheet for extra protection and comfort.
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Apr-21,DB,1,,"After wearing this mask and noticing a tickle in my throat and fibers sticking to my shaved face, I drew instant concerns about the fibers in this mask being taken into your nasal passages and inhaled your lungs. I decided to put the masks under microscope at 60xs magnification. I found some other strange things about these masks, as you can see in my photos, there appears to be some sort of fluid or chemical on portions of the mask. I tested two brand new, never used masks from the box, both having the same patterns all over the mask. Unsure what this is, but if you want to breathe in synthetic fibers along with whatever this substance may be, be my guest. I personally, would not trust this mask and I’ve thrown away the two boxes which I purchased for my third grade-teaching wife."

Upon opening the box of masks they looked normal and when initially wearing one it seemed comfortable, fast-forward to 1 hr, and the mask is wet from within. They are NOT breathable and are NOT absorbent. I had to take it off and run it under a hand dryer to dry it off. It was NASTY, and no, I am not a mouth breather nor was I talking while wearing the mask. They also gave me an allergic reaction on my chin. Definitely;y would NOT recommend these."

I think that this 50pk is definitely worth it and it’s also enough for the family. The mask is evenly distributed to cover the nose and mouth. I did notice that on these masks that the loops don’t break off the mask itself unlike other masks that I’ve had. I consider these masks heavy duty! If your a man/woman and want to set that stylish side I’d recommend this to go with any outfit of the day."

In order to remedy this situation, I have decided to purchase my own mask. Buying clothes masks was not an option, due to shrinkage  stress after a single wash. I took my chances on this on, and they are not too bad, and can  easily last up to 5 hours unless you are perspiring a lot."

I wear 2 because I feel more safe that way and they still fit just fine. They're good quality and not thin like others. They also didn't smell, which I know is a common occurrence when buying surgical masks online. Shipped very fast! I'll definitely buy these again when I run out! For transparency- I did get a card with my order linking me to their website and it said I would get a $5 Amazon gift card if I left a review, but it did NOT say the review had to be positive.

I don't know if they are 3-ply but the other masks I bought in January that claimed to be 3-ply felt as thin as these. These do not feel as sturdy or well constructed as the ones you get at Dr offices where they make you wear their masks.  I plan to double up on these ( wear two of them). Not sure why close to 5 stars, these are average although they're black so maybe others feel they deserve they deserve 1.5 stars for that. I did notice the typical Chinese seller ""you've won a prize"" card which pretty much exchanges money or gifts for a good review so maybe that's why."

When trying to blow out a lighter more Air comes through the black mask than the yellow so the flame flickers. The water doesn't drop through when filled but after the water is dumped you can almost completely blow the flame out through the wet black mask but not at all through the wet yellow mask. When we cut the black mask in half it had less layers and of a paper consistency vs the color mask which had more of the polypropylene layer so I'd purchase the colorful box again but not the black. only because this black mask seemed better than the other black masks on the Amazon market but if I can feel most air blow through it I don't believe the black mask is as effective as we would prefer.

I'm a woman with a big head, and ears. I normally buy size XL cloth face masks with the nose wire. I bought these for an emergency road trip to a State without a mask mandate and an uncontrollable high number of covid cases. A couple of the ear loops were too loose on one side, but you can double loop it around your ear. They're not tight on my ears, and they are as breathable as a surgical style mask can be. My glasses still fog a little, but they fog with all masks, even with the bendable nose wire. I wore these under a cloth mask, which is do-able. The key is to adjust both masks, and don't take them off until you're back in your home. I usually lower my mask when I get in my car, but lowering 2 masks is a pain because, they slid off my ears, and I had to readjust both of them again. If the masks tangle when taking them out of the plastic bag, flip the bag over and remove them from the other side. These masks served their purpose and I would recommend them."

They fit my face completely and extend from the middle of the nose bridge down below the chin. My girlfriend liked them so much she picked up a pack for herself! 50 masks is more than enough to keep a dozen or two in my car, and the rest in my house.

Another thing I would mention that I do not think it is gentle on the skin. When I first wore it, it made my face and nose very itchy. The second time it was okay, perhaps my skin got used to it. I am not sure what dye the company use, but for those with sensitive skin, I think you should avoid this mask. Also, it does not have a woven fabric inside the mask unlike others, so for comfort, I give it 3 out of 5."

No, they are NOT all one in the same.. I work in the restaurant/bar industry, we run hard constantly. We absolutly cannot rearrange masks, touch face to pull masks down after it starts creeping up, yadda yadda.. All the prior brands, most from Amazon, were typically really loose, or fuzzy/linty, or not breathable/very hot. I have a smaller face (female), while my coworker is a big dude and these masks were perfect! The elastic is tight enough to stay on me, but have give to be able to comfortably stay on a bigger face. The material is the best quality for these type masks I've felt and worn. Cooling, breathable, much better quality so they don't get little hairs and fuzziness when you sweat. Never shifts around! If I want an even more Secure fit, I twist the ear strap around once before pulling behind my ear for a little more snugness, and I still does not give any ear irritation. I cant be more happy to have clicked on these bad boys. It's about damn time, so much money thrown around trying to find great quality for disposable masks.

The pictures clearly show a mask with 3 layers and a white “soft” material that would be against the face but it’s the same material as the outside! It’s rough, scratchy & itchy. I wonder if this is defective somehow. Maybe they forgot to cover the inside. Whatever the reason. They are definitely not like the pictures. I really don’t think it’s supposed to have the same material for the outside used on the inside. I’m returning them because I really think they’re defective since I don’t want to believe that Amazon would let a company mislead customers. These masks got a huge amount of reviews but I don’t believe it’s the same mask for all the reviews like maybe there’s a different color or something like that. Btw, it is lightweight but I think that’s because it doesn’t have that third layer that’s supposed to be against the face... The price is cheap but that’s not really a “good deal” if the product is actually missing a layer or layers. I didn’t bother to cut it apart once I saw and felt it was missing the white layer.

I bought these because my husband has a large full beard and has had a hard time finding a mask large enough to cover His face with the surrounding beard included. This mask was just right for him. The only downside for me has been that sometimes, even with the nose wire pinched to fit me, the mask has ridden up to poke the bottom of my eye. I do not have a small face. I would say I am a large or average sized person and have a face size to match and this mask was probably a little too big for me.

This is so bad, I have to place a piece of cotton material (Tshirt homemade mask) against my skin. Of course that adder layer makes breathing quite difficult for me. The material must be poorly made.

As you can see in the second photo, THERE IS NO 3-WAY FILTER. The mask is VERY THIN. When I wear the mask, there is a noticeable gap on both sides between the mask and my face.

This might be okay for preventing others from catching your germs, but it doesn't provide very good protection for you yourself.  I have a pretty large head, and usually I have the opposite issue with masks being too tight.

These blocked out more smells than her cloth masks did for whatever that’s worth. My only complaint is they have a tendency to ride up - the top of the mask will ride up until it is resting against my lower eye lids and requires frequent adjustments. This isn’t ever mask and isn’t all day, but is a “sometimes” problem.  This may be because I have a very large head as my wife doesn’t have this issue.

Obviously there are many tiers of masks based on comfort, durability, longevity, etc. While these are comfortable, they barely last an hour or two because the bands perpetually break; not something you want occurring during an outbreak. It’s irritating if you’re putting a mask on or off (without much pressure), and the band pops. Not only that, but the label on the box actually cautions against the use of the masks if they are damaged; so what’s the use of these things if I can’t use them to begin with?! 😡"

Both sides of the mask have the same water resistant black outer layer, which makes it prone to fraying on the inside after little use. I have purchased other black masks which have a white cotton-like inner layer which does not fray—they are so much more comfortable than these masks as the frayed black fibers rub against your face and give you a constant itch. Further, the ear loops are no more comfortable than your standard white loops since they are not loose enough for people with larger heads. I do not recommend these masks"
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,18-Feb-21,Dalena,4,,"Pros: - The black color is definitely much more fashionable than the typical pale blue. - Material of the mask is sturdy and won't clog your nostrils if you try to inhale through your nose. This is a HUGE plus for me as I've regretfully become a mouth-breather due to masks being sucked into my vacuum nostrils. It's great to wear while running our working out. Cons: - Mask is too large for me that I had to tie a knot on each side of the ear loops. Granted, I am a 5'2, 110lb girl, but I have not had to tie knots on any other surgical masks that I've used in the past. - I wear glasses and this mask requires more adjustments to prevent my glasses from sliding than my current blue masks. It's possible, but you will have to play with the masks for a bit. Would I recommend it? Definitely!... if you have an average sized face and don't wear glasses.

It makes me crazy in the store or wherever.  No other masks do this. They’re made ok I got a huge box. But I gave  them away  it feels like there’s dog hairs or cat hairs in them going up my nose.  Drove me insane
disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,15-Mar-21,Carol from Idaho,4,One,I liked them. But I could only wear them 1 or 2 times for an hour or so. After that they would break down a little and I felt like there was a string on my nose that would bug me. So excellent for 1 time use. They look good and r great to breath through. Not as good if u want them to last 3 or more wear times.

The masks are light weight and as comfortable as one can expect from something covering your nose and mouth. THE PROBLEM WITH THESE is that the ear straps are not secured to the face covering NEARLY well enough! I've thrown away 4 or 5 of these before I had gotten full use from them because one of the ends of the ear loops came loose from the covering. I suppose one could staple the ear loop back onto the face covering, but .... no."

I’ve been using them for a while now and had the elastic ear strap break on only one and that was when I accidentally caught it with my thumb while taking off my reading glasses. Some of the standard disposable masks I’ve bought in the past have had multiple strap failures so I’ve been happy with these.

Otherwise, yes they look great with everything. They feel pretty large on my face, but I adapted them to my taste. For smaller heads like mine, I recommend tying off knots with the ear loops or to buy the around the head mask holder/adjusters. With the tied loops, my ears were pushed forward which caused some discomfort after long periods of time. So yeah make the jump into the extender/adjusters for mask and you'll be good.

He said he had that problem when he would ride his bike home. During P.E. he would try to keep his mouth shut when doing activities so those times wasn't a problem for him. Other than that he really likes these masks and he says they are very comfortable and better to wear than the surgical blue masks."

They’re lightweight and I can breathe, yet they are multi layered and cover the nose mouth and chin well to where I feel I’m being protected. Best Buy through this COVID period of time."

The fiber it's woven with pulls away every single time outside making you look scary and more importantly inside where you breathe them in and they are always in your mouth.  NOT like a black version of the blue disposable masks.  Wouldn't recommend."

Also I cannot confirm whether the masks are 3 ply but they are extremely thin and appear to be made from plastic rather than paper.  Every time I moved my head or jaw, the mask slipped off my nose or mouth.  Absolutely useless and I am donating them to charity with the caveat that they are not made for adults."

These masks were a great option, since you can wear black with anything, and the straps go behind your ear and don't pull on them too much. Fair warning though, these are somewhat loose-fitting so if you're looking to have a mask completely flush against your cheeks then I would consider another pair, but for a quick run into the store or something these work out perfectly!"

I've had cheap masks and these seem way better. -1 star since it's a hard to quickly tell which way goes in or out, but after further inspection it looks like these masks have the same material on the inner and outer layer. Unlike other surgical masks the inner layer material helps obsorb fluids, while the other is a material that helps repell. I put the mask on right after I opened it and had a weird smell, and probably not uncommon but I would open the box and let them sit there for a bit. For the price, it's a good mask. Not a magic mask, nothing special other than it being black. It gets the job done."

It might work to wear over another mask but I haven't had the opportunity to try that. That still wouldn't ease my mind about breathing in whatever that odor is from.

The look is exactly what I wanted. They don't seem to be as lightweight as the blue/white ones but that is not really an issue.

I use these for yoga studio and working out in a studio and they are more breathable than a cloth mask and cheap so I can discard after each use.  There is always a gap with this style on the sides but less so with this one.  I prefer black to the blue hospital color.

The first two boxes were awesome, not overly heavy but still thick and the ear strands didn't seem flimsy. I love them and preferred them over any cloth or disposable mask. However the third box I ordered the masks seem different. The mask itself seems thinner and felt different and the straps behind my ear felt stretched out and flimsy. Hopefully this box was just a mistake and they did not remake their design."

They are lightweight and allow you to breathe as much as you'd expect. BUT, all of the ones I've worn have snapped at some point. The part where the ear loops attach to the mask are very weak, and I guarantee they will break. This has happened to every single one so far. Could last a day, could last a week but it will happen. Worst part is that in most places where you're wearing a mask you obviously NEED to be wearing a mask, so I gotta always carry an extra one or two in case the current one breaks."

There is no way to truly tell which way is correct with both sides black unless the manufacturer tells you. The instructions on the box say to wear the white side to the face. The pics in the description shows 3 layers with an inside white layer. If the inside layer is supposed to be black then this would make it 4 layers of protection. Also if the mask was able to be worn on either side (meaning no incorrect way) then they would've advertised it big time as major selling point.

The lack of an “inner fabric” type layer - that the inner and outer facing layers are both the same black material - makes it feel not as well made or protective, and makes it confusing to which side should be inward or outward. Otherwise, the mask is sturdy, comfortable, lightweight, and I and have no real issues. I do double-mask. For the price and my trust that it is 3-layered as advertised, the product is good."

The only con I’ve encountered is from both sides of the mask being same color thus making it difficult to quickly distinguish which direction the mask goes on.

Usually I buy the blue nitrile ones but they were not available at the time. So I bought these instead. Total mistake. These gloves rip at the wrist every single time I put one on. Only buy these if you are extremely desperate. Appalling that companies can sell such subpar products for medical use. People with immune disorders should get prioritization like hospitals on medical supplies that we have needed for every day life before the pandemic and now even more so.

I can't imagine these are really used in the medical profession. Maybe as a last resort, as in my case. These have some thickness but they rip at the wrist before you can get them all the way on because they have little ability to stretch. They are a bit skinny and the fingers are kind of long, they aren't a true size medium. If I get them on without ripping they almost always roll up around the wrist. I'm pretty annoyed at this purchase because not only are they worst gloves I've ever used, it's price gouging, I'm getting really sick of amazon allowing this on here."

However, as long as your hands are totally dry and you slip them on slowly, carefully over the fingers first, then down your hand, they go on well. My husband and adult son are not fond of them because they break when they put them on; I have found them to go on well when I take the time as mentioned above. Yes, I have had a few break on that last pull over my palm but I usually take the time to do it carefully. I ordered more because they are more readily available and a few dollars less than nitrile. I am glad I ordered the medium size though; I have nitrile gloves in small that fit my hand nicely, but these in a small would not have worked at all. So, think about the sizing, one size up, because had I known this before and ordered the XL for my husband and adult son, they might work better for them. I like them for what I need, filling the gas tank, handling certain things from the store, going through the mail; just remember to order a size larger."

They start with tiny red itchy bumps, and end up with most of the hand/wrist being covered with severe redness/bumps, that often become flaky or crack and sometimes bleed. I’ve worked in a hospital for almost 9 years, so you can imagine the torture my hands went through, even more so with COVID. From my NP to a dermatologist, both thought my condition was either fungal infection or severe heat rash. I tried fungal, anti-itch, and steroid creams, along with specific creams for eczema and psoriasis- none of which which truly helped. Many months later (and a butt ton of money), I’ve discovered that I’m allergic to Nitrile gloves, which happens to be the only gloves my hospital uses because they’re generally powder and latex free. Since early this year, I’ve been using these gloves at work instead of the Nitrile gloves, and my hands have healed up tremendously! I’ve gone from looking like I’d dipped my hands in acid, to practically normal looking hands again. These gloves aren’t quite as durable as others and can easily rip if applying too much pressure with putting them on, so I went up to a size medium to avoid struggling with putting them on- easy fix! I don’t have a before and after photo of my hands, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. I’ll continue to repurchase these as they alone have saved my hands!!"

The ones Costco carried were perfect with regard to size, and they are (were) sturdy and affordable. These particular gloves from Amazon are quite expensive, and the medium does not fit my hands like the medium size from Costco. Because they are a little on the tight side, getting them on my hands causes them to break with ease. They're just not very stretchy and I have to be very careful with them. And they develop tears fairly easily. I've been using them for painting, and find I need to throw them out and put on a new pair after a couple of hours. I guess I need to continue my search for a better glove. Sigh."

Comments: 1. First box was large & fit a male with medium-large size hands, but difficulty getting on & off.  This was likely attributable to the fact that they're vinyl (with inherently little stretch) and powder-less, all as expected.  One shouldn't expect anything different than what one ordered. 2. Second box was for female with TINY hands , conventionally wearing size XS (or small if gloves run tight).  Based on reader reviews, ordered medium and sure glad we did!  While there's room to spare at fingertips & a bit elsewhere, clearly the small would either not fit or be challenging (and therefore tear) if we selected small. 3. Because one must oversize and have room to spare, due to the nature of vinyl, we do NOT recommend vinyl for tasks that require fine detail or good touch sensation.  But this is the nature of the beast, NOT a problem for this glove. Thanks to prior reviewers, and hope this info helps someone else!"

My hands have gotten extremely itchy, red, lots of bumps, etc.  All in all:  I hate these gloves. 2- They rip and they rip often.  If you think you're getting these ""inexpensive"" gloves and ""wow look there's so many inside!""  They probably give you so many because they rip so often, usually right around the palm area or right at the wrist.  And yes I bought the right size. 3-  Super duper thin.  Think deli gloves.

I wanted some inexpensive gloves for shopping trips, and to protect my hands from all the disinfectant wipes and sprays I'm using these days, and for when I'm loading ""contaminated"" laundry into the washer. I also use disposable gloves to clean up after the pets and handle raw meat and fish. They've served well. I also use nitrile gloves for certain tasks, and for work at my retail job. Using the cheaper vinyl gloves for quick jobs that don't require touch sensitivity helps me conserve the more expensive nitrile gloves for jobs that do. For those who haven't used vinyl gloves: They will fit much more loosely than a nitrile glove of the same size. They tend to cling to your fingernails and eventually (depending on use) start tearing where the nails poke through. Any chunky jewelry will tear them. Pulling them on too hard or with wet hands will tear them, as with disposable gloves of other materials."

If you look at the inactive ingredients you will see that water is the first ingredient (ingredients are listed in order of volume in products) on the older bottle I have bought a few months ago, water is the last inactive ingredient. No wonder this was inexpensive, it is watered down by the manufacturer. Wish I could return it. (New bottle is on the left in the picture, old bottle on the right)"

I ordered a second batch of this, and it was different.  The cap was mint green (not white), and the label was crooked.  The amount of alcohol is different (62% on the mint green cap, and 63% on the white cap).  So.......I called the manufacturer, VIJON, and left a message.  I thought I'd never hear anything, and the sweetest lady called me back in about 3 hours.  She had me read the batch numbers on both bottles, and said they are both legit.  She said they ran out of white caps, and had to switch to green caps.  She said they are producing hand sanitizer about 24 hours a day, and they are getting them out as fast as they can, so the labels are not perfect.  She also said they do make different formulas of their product, and the difference in alcohol percentage was normal. So I still don't think any of these are fake as long as you bought them from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller.  Hope that helps! I am shocked to see all the folks claiming this is fake.  I do agree the bottles weren't quite as full as I thought they should be, but we should have been paying $24 for this, rather than $18, so I wonder if a machine malfunctioned and didn't fill to the top, and they took that into consideration?? Amazon maybe got a special deal on them?  Mine were sold and shipped from Amazon, and not a 3rd party seller.  Anyway....I don't agree these are fake.  The bottles look fine, labels look legit, product inside seems fine, and smells good.  It's a strong scent of alcohol, but on my hands, I can smell the aloe!  I snagged several orders of these for myself, friends, neighbors, and our office.  Every order I got was the same, and I am pleased.  Especially since they were less than $5 a bottle!"

hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,13-May-20,BabyA,5,128,"I can't believe that people are REALLY claiming the authenticity of this Germ-X. The price is absolutely wonderful and great in a time of need to keep around. As a big germaphobe already, I have used Germ-X for years. I did receive one bottle with the top squished and I lost a small amount of sanitizer, which was probably due to poor package handling. The bottles were not sealed but lids tightly screwed and this is normal, even when bought at Walmart they aren't sealed. My bottles weren't filled to the top but no sanitizer I've ever bought has been filled to the top.. The scent is light, sanitizer isn't sticky and provides you with the coverage you need to keep your hands germ free. If you haven't used Germ-X as a child in school or as an adult in your everyday routine, you'll be naive to others claims. And unless your bottle is turned upside down in the box, even with improper package handling, it isn't possible that every last ounce was emptied out. If you still aren't convinced, if you have it and don't believe it's real then just take a sniff and you'll quickly smell the alcohol. It is the regular consistency of hand sanitizer as well."

Called as soon as I have the lady the batch number she told me the bottle size and percent Alcohol. She also said the formula is different from old bottles but it is a genuine product. I went to a ""germX"" website and asked her she said it's a third party site so they don't have anything to do with it listing the old formula in the ingredients. Let's all relax the system still works. GermX customer service was great but I felt stupid for calling, it's real. To address the bottles being sealed.... Never have I bought germX at Walmart and the bottle was sealed, people are just paying attention now when they were oblivious before. Hope this helps."

Smells awful but that's hand sanitizer. There's no plastic safety wrap or inner seal, so for those who got (double) crushed boxes, peeling labels, leaky uneven bottles, I don't know who you can blame.

Then the disappointment set in after opening the box, I could see right away that these 4 bottles are NOT the normal Germ-X I have bought in the stores before the crisis.  They were watery and the smell is different compared to the ones I just had bought at a well-known grocery store a few weeks ago. Now I'm out of the $$ as you cannot return this item due safety reasons, flammable, etc (but they can be delivered... ??).  How can I be confident that my order is safe to use?  There was NO seals on any of the bottles and the caps were barely on there, this just DOES NOT look nor smell the same as of other bottles of Germ-X I have.  I will not be using this crap on my hands, just can't trust what may be in these bottles.  With all the news media showing certain companies/brands adding methanol, who can trust that is not in these?  AGAIN, NO SEALS ON BOTTLES. It's just NOT worth the risk.

Mine also didn’t come with a seal under the cap (clear cap). It also doesn’t smell amazing at all. However, I SO want it to be legit so I called the customer complaint line from the back of the label. Based on the lot number, they were able to verify my product, they knew the expire date (which matches the bottles). They explained that they have two “original” formulas and this one is simply different ingredients but equally effective.

I received my order today (after waiting nearly a month), and it's for real.  The bottles came in a sealed Germ X box, and there was no leakage.  They are flip tops, and the bottle are not sealed, but they aren't sealed if you find them on a store shelf either.  My cousin got a 32-ounce bottle at Target, and he verified that.  The bottles held slightly different amounts, but the one with the least fluid had as much as the picture my cousin sent.  Also, I had talked to Vi-Jon the manufacturer, when I saw the review, and the person told me to look for a seven-digit batch number in black. probably starting with ""04,"" followed by the expiration date, and all the bottles had that.  They are all from the same batch.  It feels fine and smells good.  So, after all that, I'm very satisfied and these bottles will last me for a very long time."

I even had a foil seal under the plastic cap. It smells a little alcohol-y, but some sanitizers always did. I was using 91% alcohol anyway. It seems a little watery, but I've been using liquid (not gel) sanitizer and alcohol in spray bottles. Is it real Germ-X? I don't care, I have been buying sanitizer from distilleries for $40/gallon. It was extra for gel. People were selling expired sanitizer, so there's that. Things that may be a deterrent for some didn't matter to me. Fast shipping, No leaks. Good price.

It was really runny- not the gel Sanitizer I remember using pre-Covid.. and it has a really strong scent. Definitely not “unscented”! I wish it was just an alcohol scent to it! It smells rotten and lingers on my hands. The only good thing I can say about it is that while it was sliding through my hands like water since it’s more like a turning a 2 liter of coke up than a gel hand sanitizer to get a glob out into your palm!!!- it did sting a paper cut on the underside of my hand! So it should do the job if you can manage to get it on every side of your hands and leave it that for a few seconds to do its thing! Really disappointed! I know like everyone else that ordered this, I was SO disappointed that this wasn’t the real thing! After months of hunting for the name brand we are accustomed to and it being sold out and hoarded by selfish people- I was excited to get a few bottles to have to give to my kids’ teachers in August, family members, friends, and bus drivers! People who would need something that would STICK! Not this stuff that slips right though your fingers and smells like *censored because you wouldn’t post this review if I told you how it really smelled!!!* Sick of 2020 being the year of lies and being taken advantage of at every single turn! Shame on your amazon and YOU TOO GERM-X! I’d return it but all the other hand sanitizer is just as awful and at this point, I have to make do with something awful.

If I had ordered hand sanitizer from another brand and this is what I got, I wouldn’t care because i know it’s gonna be different. But this feels extremely cheap and ripped off.

It smelled like cheap vodka gone bad! As far as the consistency of the product, it is very watery and not gel like. I actually found the same product at Target and the consistency was the same like these bottles from Amazon, very watery. I wish I could return the second set I bought because the smell is truly horrible, and I don’t think anyone would want that smell on their hands. It seems like the manufacturer of this product is cutting corners in order to mass produce. They are reducing the amount of gel that is normally put in the product, and they’re not adding any fragrance, which leads people to believe they’re getting fake GermX.

I noticed that none of the bottles had a foil seal, not really sure if any of the ones I purchase at the store have them but it definitely caught my attention. One bottle was only half full and the cap was barely on the bottle. I used a tiny amount to try it out and oh my goodness if I had an appetite let's say I wouldn't have had one after smelling the sanitizer. It smells like a mix of baby vomit, baby poop, a hint of a multipurpose flowery scented cleaning solution, a retirement home or cheap motel, and air freshener sprayed into the air after someone has taken a massive dump and tried to mask the scent. I added 91% isopropyl alcohol to the bottle that was half filled and it barely reduced the scent of the very detailed mixture of scents I described. I hate having to return items especially by shipping soooooo I guess I'll be transferring them into different bottles where I can add more isopropyl alcohol. Do yourself a favor, just go to your local pharmacy or department store and purchase what you know works and doesn't wreak so bad"

Product is authentic, delivered undamaged, bottles are full with no leakage, and last but not least,.........the price for the quantity is great. This will keep me for a good length of time, and I can even give away a bottle or two to friends that need it."
hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-Aug-20,J...,4,One,"The price that I paid on Amazon for four 32 ounce bottles of hand sanitizer from a well-known manufacturer is pretty terrific. It sells out fast and I had to check back often to get an order placed. The version that I received is 62% ethyl alcohol, so it meets CDC requirements for ethyl alcohol based hand sanitizer. The good news is it doesn't smell awful - it's almost kind of pleasant with just a very mild alcohol aroma. I've purchased other hand sanitizers made with ethyl alcohol/ethanol and they've smelled strongly like cheap tequila, so it's a relief that this product has a non-offensive scent. While technically a gel, it's somewhat thin and runny. The consistency is okay once you know what to expect - just rub it in quickly so none drips off. After it dries, there's no stickiness and perhaps there's a plus for not being a thicker gel. The expiration date is just under 2 years from now, so no worries about aging out before using it all up. Delivery was much sooner than the original estimated date, like a couple weeks sooner. The bad news is my shipment leaked, like many other reviewers have noted. One of the four bottles had a faulty flip top - had a hole in it directly over the little pour spout. The bottle lost about 15% of its contents. I opened the box within a couple hours after delivery, so maybe I'm lucky that I got to it before more leaked out. The other three bottles were fine. If you order, just make sure to check for any leakage promptly upon delivery."

Will not order again.

I purchased this over a month ago and figured and received it yesterday. I expected the delay and that was fine. Two bottles had leaked all over the box. The other two had lids that were barely on. I can deal with that. It happens. But the smell is ATROCIOUS! My kids refuse to have it on their hands. It made one of them gag. I can't place the smell but it's not alcohol and definitely does not smell like other bottles I have around the house. There is also a very sticky feel to the gel. I had to wash my hands after using it because the stickiness would not go away. Now I'm stuck with a 4 pack that I was going to use to fill up the kid's small bottles they keep at school. I have to donate a product such as this. Don't want anyone else using it!

I got them today and the scent is horrible and smells like cheap restaurant hand soap and the fragrance will remain on your hands for awhile after using.  I tried to return them but unfortunately you are not able to return them.  If you are sensitive too smell I would recommend avoiding these and just buying GermX from the store.

You'll get 4x 32 fl oz bottles with a lot missing.  They were placed in a box (none seemed to be spilled inside), but 3 out of 4 bottles were squeezed and dented.  Either this was accidental or an attempt to make it look like the bottles were more full than they were. Whether there's some conspiracy to screw me out of product or not, bottom line, I was screwed out of product.  I filled 3 of the bottles up with one of the others to make it easier to see how much you should have VS how much you're getting ripped off.  Up to you whether they're worth buying or not, but know they're not packaged with plastic seals and they'll be missing product, whether they spill in the box or not."

Yes we are in a pandemic and these are high demand items so the company may cut back on something that they may feel is safe to do in order to make sure its enough to go around rather than not enough at all... I purchased Clorox Germicide from Home Depot and received different labels but i check it and its the same product...

If you smell straight from the big bottle it doesn't smell the greatest however when it's on my hand I dont notice an overwhelming smell. Doesn't leave hands sticky like.some other brands which I love. Great price to refill bottle at home and to send to school with kids."

Im so glad I did, since my work reopened in early May and we could not source any hand sanitizer from the usual corporate options. This supply refilled our bottles at work stations and more. I lucked out and was able to purchase a second time, so we had some future refills. This IS the genuine GermX product, despite what some other reviews state, and has helped us tremendously at our doctor's office.

When I received the product I could smell the Germ X before I opened the box. The second box was intact, but the first box that the product was in, had 2 of the bottles damaged at the top which allowed some of the Germ X to escape and spill into the box. Gladly I had just finished a large bottle of sanitizer and was able to pour what was left of the 2 damaged bottles in another bottle.  I was only offered to return the Germ X not to replace it.  Too missy to return."

Purchased a smaller bottle from target to compare. Same thing. It is legit and original Germ X. The reason why the consistency and thickness isn’t the same is because there is a severe shortage of ingredients used to manufacture this product. Seeing as most of the ingredients for Clorox wipes, hand sanitizers, Lysol sprays and all the other high demand items are from overseas quality of product isn’t the same.

The remaining 10 to 12 ounces of the product coated the interior of the inner box and the outer surfaces of the bottles with the jelly like goo beginning to dissolve the adhesive holding the bottle labels in place. On a positive note the inner cardboard box with it's liberal coating of sanitizer is now 100% COVID protected .. Me ? not so much now.

Sanitizer is much more watery than others, which is not a problem and it is not sticky like others.  Definitely smell the alcohol in the product, but has not other smell.  Product does meet my family needs.  Packing is horrible as many others have commented on for this product type-4 large bottles in one box.  All for caps were loose in the box and product seeped out from all four bottles.  About one inch from each bottle.  Other vendors who I received similar products put tape around caps to ensure no opening during transit.  Beware, you may be one of the unlucky purchasers, like many whose product will be inside the contents of the box.  Product is double mixed boxed, however this does not help leakage."

It can be used to refill smaller pump bottles or refill pocket size bottles. Seems less expensive to buy these big bottle to refill your smaller bottles. I guess you could use these big bottles on a larger scale if you really big hands. Smells like, um, Germ-X. So, no surprise there. It is a clear gel type liquid, which would be expected if you have ever used Germ-X. As the label says, it is for hands, so don't do stupid stuff and use it all over your body. I have a feeling that may not end well. If you get it in your eyes it is irritating, so use it only as directed by the manufacturer. READ THE LABEL. And hey, go to their website and read up on it if you are the type of person to use things in ways they are not intended."

When comparing consistency, smell, ingredients and the fine print, I saw some discrepancies between store bought germ-x versus the amazon purchased ones. Store bought germ x has a very nice pleasant smell. Amazon's has a pungent alcohol smell and not at all pleasant. Store bought say 63% alcohol versus Amazon's 62%. Shouldn't the same brand be consistent all around? Even the typing was a bit off, such as the order of the inactive ingredients and using the symbol '&' in Amazon's product versus AND in the store bought. I'm more than certain these are counterfeit but not worth the trouble to return. As far as the 5-star reviews...I don't know..seems very suspect to me. But if it's safe hand sanitizer, I guess it's worth the cost, but it's definitely not the real deal. Buyer beware!"

Some industrial sanitizers like they have in offices or public spaces have a nasty odor that smell like a full garbage truck on a hot summer day.

Some of the bottles in the box packaged by Germ-x (NOT the Amazon packaging) had very loose caps that I had to tighten after I took them out.

So, when I saw this offer at a reasonable price, I  jumped at it. I'll use it but I was disappointed.  The alcohol smell is simply overwhelming and it is pure liquid with a watery consistency, not remotely gel like. It just runs off your hands if you aren't very careful when you pour it out of the bottle. If the smell is any indication, it does indeed have the stated alchohol content in it and should kill germs effectively.  Since that's the ultimate point,  I suppose it'll get the job done but I'm not thrilled.  I can't wait until I can get my hands on some Germ-X  Gel Sanitizer with Aloe but who knows how long it will be until that's available again."

Don't buy this , if you even go to Germ-x's site, they don't even show this bottle type or the scent.  It seems either this was counterfit or something went bad in terms of the sanitizer or the scent. I just wasted $40 and not the manufacturer or Amazon doesn't care.  It seems I'll need to start taking up to the BBB board on both Amazon and Germ-x and Vijon about this issue.  This product really induced a nauseous feeling ,and it lingers.

Then, I noticed that these seemed kind of watery and I glanced at another review that pointed out the main inactive ingredient was water. I confirmed tat on mine. The main INACTIVE ingredient is water. I've never seen GermX be this watery before. I've always seen if have a gel-type of consistency, not watery. I would not but these again.

The price was also fair given the shortage and demand these days. The only complaint that I had, and echoed by others in the reviews, is that apparently some slight amount leaked out in transit, so packaging could be better. We're talking way under 10% so it's not a dealbreaker and worth sending back, but just a slight annoyance. Would still recommend at a reasonable price."

Although I'm grateful to have it, the odor is so off putting I think I'd rather donate it than use it myself. In addition it makes me wonder if this is some other hand sanitizer (likely one that we were warned to not buy due to the addition of menthol) and that's why it smells so GOD DAMN HORRIBLE.

This is like water and it smells like cheap hand sanitizer. I only buy germx so when I saw this I was elated with the deal. I wish I had read reviews. I know they are mixed but mine IS NOT legit germx. I have shown my purchase this to several different people and they agree. I don’t know if they are making so much of it they are cutting corners but I am disappointed with this product.

It's runny like some of the off-brands I've bought over the past 3 or 4 months. Maybe that's just the way it's being made these days, I don't know. However, my very first thoughts was that it had been ""watered"" down, although I know that actual water could not be used for that purpose in this product. I'm going to buy a small bottle the next time local stores has it to compare the thickness. If there is a difference I intend to come back here and update my review."

It doesn't appear that the box was opened previously (no damage to cardboard, no second layer of tape, etc). Of the three bottles, there were two different ""recipes"" of hand sanitizer (labels indicate slightly different compositions). Two of the bottles contained sanitizer that is more watery, smells more strongly of alcohol, and were not completely full. The caps on those two was also significantly ""looser"" than the third bottle, so I am a bit concerned that the lower level of sanitizer may reflect that some of the alcohol has already evaporated out. The third bottle is closer to the product I was hoping to receive (less watery, less smell, and full bottle) with all bottles. Amazon support resolved this to my satisfaction, so overall I am reasonably satisfied with the product delivered under the circumstances, but not entirely happy. The lack of the fourth bottle is a longer term inconvenience and the inconsistency of receiving two different formulations in the same box feels odd as a consumer."

I bought a pineapple scent to add to it expecting that the scent wouldn’t be super pleasant. But I also didn’t expect it to be as viscous as water. If you can find something else in store do it.

I compared the consistency and feel/smell to other hand sanitizers I had in the house and it was spot on in every aspect except the Germ -X was ever so slightly looser than others.

It isnt harsh on my hands and I have super dry skin. For the price it was a steal. Only downside is a bottle came busted so I pretty much lost half a bottle and had a mess to clean up thats why i didnt give it a fantastic review. shouldnt have been shipped i think in a box with nothing even stuffing it so it was able to just crash around in the box. Either way the sanitizer is great.

The other purchase was just a week ago but also arrived at the same time. Fortunately, none of my bottles were leaking compared to the other reviews I've read. The bottles that I bought a month ago, came from VA and they had the white cap. The bottles that I bought last week were from IN and they had the other turquoise cap and also came sealed. Also, the background color on the sticker (where it says original hand sanitizer for the turquoise cap is a different shade of blue compared to the white cap (The white cap had a lighter blue sticker). All of these give me an impression that it's not the actual germ-x (not like I would know). I would still buy these as long as it's hand sanitizer and for the great value. Buy at your own risk. I also purchased a different germ-x bottle (aloe with pumps). The box they were in had the germ-x logo on it while these did not."

Hand sanitizers are still kind of difficult to find in my area so when I saw these for under $20 I had to purchase them even it had still had a few at home. The amount I received for the price was excellent. About the product itself; It does exactly what it’s suppose to do which is sanitize your hands. It doesn’t leave my hands dry and I do have sensitive skin. I recommend these esp at under $20 for six bottles of 32 ounces.
hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,5-Jan-21,Zack Kisciras,5,One,Great product! When I purchased these bottles of sanitizer I was nervous that they would leak in the box during shipment because of what other customers were saying in the reviews but since there were many positive reviews as well I decided to take my chances. I got lucky and my box only had one very tiny leak in one of the bottles which was from a loose cap and only a couple of drops leaked out. I think that this company should put seals on these bottles so that way even if the caps do get loose nothing will leak out during shipment. Overall very good product and one of the best deals on high quality hand sanitizer on Amazon!

hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,29-Jun-20,Zak,1,2,Germ-X is really hard to come by and so this seemed like a good deal. The flip top of one of the bottles broke off during shipping. I only lost about 2 inches of product but I did have a slimy mess to clean up. There was a 2-3 inch gap between the top of the bottles and the top of the box - my guess is that the bottles slid repeatedly during shipping due to this poor packaging. More of a problem is that the product smells like feet (my son’s words). It does not smell like any GermX I have ever used before. I am not sure we will be able to use it due to the stench. Due to the spillage the odor was quite pungent when I opened the box! I would not order again.

It smells extremely strong, like wood alcohol. I do not think this is authentic germ-x. I work in healthcare and this hand sanitizer is very questionable! I am disappointed Amazon will not allow me to return this or give a refund. Some alcohols can be toxic to your body and I am definitely not risking my family and I getting sick from toxic hand sanitizer."

Other reviews have complained about the formula or texture; apparently the GermX product they received isn't the same as it was prior to the pandemic. I cannot speak to that, but I don't particularly care whether it's true or not. The fact is that the product that I received seems likely to be as effective as any hand sanitizer. It leaves a reasonably nice scent without stickiness or residue. It may be that it has a strong alcohol scent when initially applied (compared to the original formula), but I personally don't care about that one bit. In short: I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The product that I received doesn't have any of the problems that you associate with the cheap hand sanitizer that has apparently flooded the market. It might be slightly inferior to ultra premium hand sanitizers such as Purell, but not enough for it to matter."

It no longer have the pleasant smell and have a very strong rubbing alcohol smell.  Also it's not as thick as the previous formula.  It also isn't fill up all the way either.  Seem like as demand for these went up, the quality went down.  I was happy I was able to score some to share with family and friends, but am disappointed in the new formula."

The smell of the GermX is fine, i personally like it.  Kills germs and virus, so can't complain about that."

Definitely more water and does not smell as strong as the other bottle."

I noticed it does not have the same scented smell real germx has because my boss bought a identical bottle from rite aid pharmacy. And I noticed mine smells like just straight up alcohol.

I ordered 3 boxes for the company and one of them came very damaged and one of the bottles had leaked all over part of the box, and the other three were indented in. Because of a tight schedule need and not wanting to waste, we kept them but otherwise would have sent this box back. One of the lids was broken off so we will have to transfer it to another container. The other two were fine, and the larger box they all came in wasn't damaged, so it must have happened at the warehouse, rather than in transit. Some have said it was watered down, but from the gel on the box, I'd say it's pretty normal hand sanitizer. I think it will work well."

The bottle i got from target was mint color cap. As other customer reviewer said, the company might run out of different color caps, so i was not worry too much about it. Also I understand that durning the pandemic they have to produce the product in such a short amount of time and such big demand, so i wont judge it by the label that not tapped flat and there is no seal under the cap. In general, very good product and there is no leakage in my paper box at all. Thanks a lot."
hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,24-Jun-20,Breezy-B,4,,"The package came double sealed (outer box, internal box) with no damage, no leakage. Each bottle was filled, probably at the 90% mark. Like many comments, this isn’t the original formula of Germ-X, but it is authentic. If everyone still doesn’t understand why, you need to know that a massive scarcity has forced hand-sanitizing manufacturers, or those transitioning their manufacturing facility to make sanitizing products, to make their own version. For many, this translates into the use of ethanol for hand-sanitizer production from Isopropyl alcohol, a colorless, flammable chemical compound often used in hand sanitizers."

The only regret is that we didn't realize that the ethyl alcohol percentage is 62%. We aim to buy hand sanitizers that have an alcohol percentage that is 70% or higher. But I'm sure it still works effectively.
hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,17-Sep-20,Nicole LePera,1,,"I have used Germ-X for years and don’t think this is the real stuff. The scent smells more like grain alcohol and it is very watery. I am very familiar with how it feels and smells and this wasn’t it. The bottles arrived not sealed and one of the caps was just sitting on top. It seems the real product may have been removed and replaced with a homemade variety, and there’s no telling what the ingredients are or even if it is safe to use. I wish I hadn't tried it, because I have no idea what I just put on my hands. UPDATE: My hands turned very raw and red shortly after using this."

EVERY SINGLE bottle had to be tightened when I opened the bag... I guess this doesn't ship in a sealed box, just thrown in a bag. Just beware that if you get the delivery and your first words are ""Man, I can smell the hand sanitizer!"" .. it's for a reason."

Germ-X doesn't have an offensive smell like some other brands out there. I have tried some hand sanitizers that I put a little squirt on my hands and I can't stomach the smell and can't wash my hands enough to get rid of the smell.  We recommend this hand sanitizer and this seller is offering a great deal.
hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,2-Oct-20,Reba,5,,"I read the reviews and saw so many arriving damaged and leaking. Because of the brand and the great price, I decided to take a chance. I was very happy when they arrived today and not a single one was damaged or leaking. It is 62% ethyl alcohol, which will do the job per the CDC. Smells like rubbing alcohol to me. Much better than the tequila smell of some others we purchased.  It is more watery than I'm used to, but I think the thickening agents are in short supply. Happy to have a good supply on hand for the upcoming fall and winter season!"

One of the boxes had the lids loose on almost every bottle, and one bottle was about half full from spillage. The other box the lids were loose and the bottles were wet, and one bottle had lost about a quarter or slightly less, but they were all messy with spillage. I'm hoping I will get one bottle to replace what had spilled. Of course its a breeze to clean up, so that part isn't a big deal."

Threw the product out and tried to leave a review advising I thought it was a fraudulent product.  It was moderated and I was advised they would not post my review."

However, now I feel like I got bamboozled. I literally just received these items and let me just say I was deeply disturbed as the bottles look tampered with. Two of the bottles have dish soap lids and don’t look original. I have no idea what I received in those bottles. As you can see in the picture some bottles have more liquid than others. The bottles were sticky and also the bag they were wrapped in was pretty gross. I had to wash my hands immediately after. I won’t be buying from this seller again."

Two bottles had damaged lids, one of which had been completely torn off. Better packaging would have prevented this. Needless to say, I didn't get the volume of sanitizer I paid for. The box, on the other hand, was fairly germ free! Also, I wanted to add that I compared the bottle's labeling, ingredients (active, inactive, and order of ingredients), smell, and viscosity to a recent Office Dep. purchase. Everything was exactly same. Seems to be legit."

I have a little Germ-X left and I took a picture of the differences between the 2. Since it's from Amazon, I assume they put their ""own"" brand in them.

The flip top gets loose easily and there is always some spillage in the box when delivered. There is no seal. Recommend for the manufacturer or amazon to tape the caps to prevent item from spilling. My other complaint as well is that the bottle is never full specifically for these bottle types. Either the products evaporate because the caps are loose, they spill, or the manufacturer does not fill to top. I don’t seem to have issue with other items from Germ-X."

The seals were all broken and placed back on to pass as if they were new. Also the label on the bottle looks like it was placed on (they are crooked, have bubbles and creases). To the people saying they received authentic hand sanitizer that’s good for you but also note that your bottles (which you say are authentic) are different from the bottles of the people saying they are fake.

One of the lids was popped open. A different bottle was at a much lower (and quite obvious) fill level than the other three bottles.

As others have said, the product arrived in a sealed box from the manufacturer that was then packaged into an Amazon box, but all bottles arrived leaking or completely opened. As a result, all bottles were about 3/4 full. I am still appreciative of the price point, but this was a giant mess."

Yes it took more wipes then normal.  I usually only use these in the bathroom.  I normall uae vinegar and water to clean the house but, saw a lot of bad reviews on here.  So yes I have to agree with others they I will not buying these again.  I bought the Clorox ones on here and, they were awesome.  I think Lysol was not as good anymore or maybe just from Amazon."
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,15-May-17,Daniela,5,92,"Let's face it, cleaning is already a task most of us do not look forward to so why not make it easier? For me, wipes are the answer. Before these I was spraying with a cleaner that was probably spraying in places I didn't want it to, waiting for the cleaner to soak in before using paper towels to finally wipe off the food particles and spills. Now I simply grab a wipe out of the container and everything comes off in one step and I can clean with the wipe exactly where I want to, unlike a spray. The packaging makes it easy to tear off one or as many as you need and closes tightly. These work better to really help loosen and remove any stuck on food that I would usually have to scrub off with other cleaning products. I should also mention I used to buy Clorox wipes but these leave less lint than the Clorox did. I would have to wipe the lint away with a rag after cleaning with those, not saving me any time. These Lysol wipes work great, one goes a long way and they arrived in perfect condition. I'll be buying for life (until one day when I hopefully become rich and can afford a great housekeeper, that is.)"
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,18-Jan-18,The eBook Investigator,1,81,I've always been a fan of Lysol but certainly not these. Every time I try to clean with them I end up with an awful headache. I must add that I'm sensitive to fragrances and ones that bother me tend to lead to migraines like these do. Not worth it for me to go through the misery. If you don't have those types of sensitivities they may work out well.
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,6-Apr-18,KJ,1,73,I received these yesterday and they were a soggy mess.  When I removed the outer wrapping all of the canister labels came with it because they were soaking wet.  It's impossible to tell how many of the canisters leaked but there was a whole lot of product lost to leakage.

Not enough liquid solution. It’s hard to disinfect a surface when the wipe is dry.  I noticed Clorox weights 581g(78 wipes) vs Lysol only 473g(80 wipes).  Lysol is lighter, definitely dryer."

We keep them in the kitchen for things like wiping down countertops after preparing chicken or other foods that might carry bacteria.  A  quick wipe down with them on the counters, stovetop, etc. makes us all feel a little safer about what we eat and where we prepare our food.  They clean, plus give you the satisfaction of knowing that you are not only cleaning, but you are disinfecting at the same time.  A must-have for the whole house."

Right off the bat I could smell the lemon scent before I had even removed the wipes from the bag. Then I reached in the bag and felt the moisture. It was my original intention to give these wipes to my son and his wife. After opening the plastic wrap around the containers I came across loose, torn and wet labels. There is no way I can give these to anyone. Due to the loss of liquid there is no telling how effective they will be. I do have a 2nd order going direct to my daughter in NY. I hope her shipment has better luck. Update; 5/30/20 The 2nd order arrived at my daughter's house in perfect condition. This time it was in a box and shipped out of Texas. Mine as mentioned above was in a plastic bag and shipped out of Michigan. The system will not allow me to write a different review for the new shipment. I thought it only fair to report to good results as well as the bad."

The old old one came wet, there was excess liquid in every container. This is ridiculous, this cleaning liquid costs practically nothing to make. The price is now over 25 percent higher than before. Not going to be repurchasing an overpriced roll of tiny paper towels which are barely moist."

I will be dropping most of mine of at a nurse's home who works directly with COVID patients. Please do not hoard these in these times and check in with your essential worker friends/family to see if they need any. Message from a nurse: As some of you know for 5 and a half weeks now I’ve been caring for Covid 19 patients in the ICU/Emergency Room and Step down units. In the very beginning we used a new face shield, mask and gown every time we entered a room. We are now allowed one mask every 3 shifts and one face shield forever. We depend on wipes to clean our face shields every time we exit a room. Without being able to clean these we would be passing the virus from room to room and literally be bringing it home in our cars/on our shoes to our families. We also use these wipes for shared equipment (X-ray machines, dialysis machines etc) I know these have been really hard to find, but if anyone scored some, my colleagues, patients and I would love any wipes you’d be able to share"

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,7-Jan-20,ArgoFX,1,9,The picture for this product is deceptive. It shows that it will be in a plastic can but what I received definitely wasn’t in a plastic can. It’s in a bag form instead where you open the plastic lid attached to the bag and pull out a wipe. Similar to like baby wipe packaging and one can easily get them mixed up which is why I liked the cans better. It’s not worth the trouble for me to go and return them though. They should update the image to this product so that they’re not tricking customers regarding what they will receive.

A tip for those that travel: put a few of these in a sandwich bag and they’ll stay good when you travel. Better, cheaper way to wipe down tray tables and arm rests. At the hotel wipe down doorknobs, light switches and the tv controller. Carry the same in car or purse and save vs buying the travel packs with their massive convenience markup. Happy travels!"

I've always loved Lysol products and this is no different. The wipes have a good thickness to them and won't disintegrate or get destroyed when you're using them to sanitize your surroundings or objects. The scent is nice as well and it's really nice just having a couple delivered to your door. Would definitely buy again as they have been my go-to wise for years but as you know they can be very hard to find right now.

It won't take off a wine stain on the cheap counters at my apartment, I still have to break out spot cleaner for that. I switch out between these, Clorox and Wegmans brands and they are all pretty comparable."

The packaging is leak proof from our experience, and the scent is clean without being overpowering. Each towelette is a good size ..not tiny, and there are plenty wet. When we have finished using them there is still some of the liquid in the bottom of the plastic container.

Clorox has an air tight film cover on every new canister, which is helpful to prevent leak in delivery transportation. I wish Lysol does the same thing. Lysol offers a better price instead so cannot be compared with any absolute standard. Anyway, I cannot choose one from the other during this pandemic. I should snap whatever is available for sale without looking at its brand. By the way, when can I buy Solimo wipes again ?"

Don't use this as a substitute for hand washing or deep cleaning, but it does the trick between jobs and traveling. Very convenient. I hate the use of too much plastic, but weighing out risk/benefits, this one is a necessity.  I don't have kids in school, but if I did, there would be one in every backpack and locker. :)"

The design of the container is unique you can easily put your fingers in the big opening and take out a wipe or more without unscrewing the top and place the unused end into the notch and start feeding the roll. It pulls out and then rips cleanly since there are perforations. Other brands require you to constantly unscrew the top to feed the wipes that keep slipping back in or rip halfway. The scent on this is STRONG. That way my clients will know that I wiped down the treatment table and stuff. If you use it too much it may cause nasal discomfort, which is why I swap other lesser scented brands like Amazons Solimo, heh heh.

Something smushed the containers and several of them leaked cleaning fluid all over everything in the box. By the time we got the box, mildew had started to form in the cardboard under one of the Lysol containers. Everything else in the box was small: various makeups which were sealed and fine but slimy, small fidget toys which were not harmed by cleaning fluid, but also a pack of toothbrushes which had the cardboard backing all soaked, so they will need to go through the dishwasher before we put them in our mouths. Lysol is not toothpaste. Lol"

There was a minor amount of leaking in my box, but nothing huge. The wipes are all still wet and the labels on each canister mostly survived. I believe the canisters look different than in the photo (ie, with the clear tops instead of the yellow) because Lysol and Clorox are producing as much as they can as quickly as they can, which probably means obtaining different containers. Fine by me! Also, if you have a container running out, you can use the leftover liquid from that one and pour it into one of these if yours is too dry. Also, when I first ordered mine the delivery estimate was July 13, but it changed and they came today! I ordered these five days ago, May 23."

I use these bad boys to clean pretty much everything in my house right now, as we have people who go out into the world to work and such. I know, I'm probably being crazy, but I don't really care. I used to use these to wipe my counters down in the kitchen and clean the bathrooms and all. I don't really think you can go too wrong with having a kitchen that's too clean or a bathroom that's too clean. As a side note, does anyone else really just like the scent of lemon in their kitchen? I usually prefer the fresh (blue/green) scent for the bathroom and this lemon (yellow) scent for my kitchen. Maybe that's weird, idk."

I put tape around the tops of the ones I'm not yet using because I want to keep the smelly liquid in and the stench out!

Only thing I don’t like is the snap lid doesn't snap as easily as the ones I used to get in the stores when I could a actually find them.

The smell is slightly strong, so if you have a sensitive nose, I would suggest wearing a mask. Discovering that its use can also work on electronics was surprising, and after testing the wipes on my laptop, phone, electronic accessories, and game consoles, I have considered purchasing more in bulk very soon. The wipes kill bacteria on their surfaces, which is especially acknowledgeable during the current COVID-19 pandemic. For those who eat-and-game with messy hands, these wipes do their job at leaving controllers and screens with a smooth, shiny, and dry finish with just one wipe alone. In fact, a single wipe can stay moist for an extended period of time, so do not be concerned if a wipe will not be enough to clean a single area or device."

They arrived in their usual sealed packaging (it’s a 4-pack) in a typical shipping box.  For whatever reason, the Lysol company no longer had a seal on the tops of the individual containers of wipes and once I opened the sealed packaging there was liquid all throughout.  As I am in desperate need of wipes, I found 3 of the containers leaked only a little bit, while the 4th is quite dry.

I was so worried I’d get a box of old or imitation wipes based on sites and reviews I’d seen. But these were just like the ones I used to buy from the stores. Very relieved and happy! My only disapproval was the delivery person left my box randomly nearby my apartment rather than right in front of my door.

Packaging is difficult to keep wipes in the ""tear"" area and wipes do not tear every time, so pull carefully.  Other than that they are great.  If the wipes fall on their side, the liquid does not all drain out, which is a vast improvement over past designs.  I carry a pack in my car so I can sanitize when I go into the store if they do not have wipes available for shoppers.  I did this before covid but now it is even more important.

It got everywhere.  I almost feel like the company cut corners in a hurry to make product available to the masses given the current health crisis.

The packages contain more liquid disinfectant than some other brands, so you can clean off a larger surface with just one wipe. This also means that all wipes are wet, and you shouldn’t have to discard the last ones in the container.  (Some other brands’ wipes tend to dry up before you use the entire container.) I’ve deducted one star because of the scent.  Although it’s not a bad smell, it’s a bit strong and could be too much for those who are sensitive to scented products."

As many others here have caught on, there was a change in the quality of the wipes in the past year or two.

Something had to have busted or leaked at some point during the shipping process because when I opened the shrink wrap that was over all 4 containers, it ripped off all the slightly damp labels. Not a terribly big deal since having a container sans label makes no difference to the product itself, but it did have me a little perplexed and concerned as to why each bottle's label was already damp in the first place.

My Mom lives in a very remote area and has cancer.  She needs this but her white blood cell count is too low for her to get out in public to purchase items or take the damaged items back to be returned and needed to start using them immediately.  She doesn't have internet and I live in another state.  I tried to let Amazon know this but what I found access to is a return.  Since she needed it immediately, started to use the first one.  I fear the others will dry out before she can use them.  So am not able to return them because of using the first one."

My only beef is they were shipped in a poly bag and arrived a little smashed and wet. No seals on the top of the canisters so some of the liquid seeped out and destroyed the labels. Lysol usually overfills anyway so I just removed the wet paper and there was still plenty of solution on the wipes.

The smell is wonderful and it definitely leaves a clean feeling. I do agree with the packaging though. It was delivered in a way that you are not sure which way is bottom or top so when you do open them and it was packaged the wrong way the package leaks solution and the wipes dry out quicker. If they can fix this problem by putting a seal or a tighter fitting cap they will have a customer for life. Thanks LYSOL!!

However, it seems like the wipe quality has decreased. They still get things clean, but leave lint everywhere they are used so I have to wipe up after them. The wipes also seem to be thinner and wear out quickly while I'm using them. Also, upon delivery the containers were in rough condition. The containers had leaked cleaning solution. I wasn't worried about the labels being damaged so much as I was that there wouldn't be enough liquid remaining to keep the wipes from drying out."

Oh my God, it smells exactly like an old lady's perm!! I thought I would be able to ignore the scent & would get used to it, but instead, it just gets worse every time I use it. Needless to say, i will gifting the entire box of these soaps to anyone willing to take them - If anyone needs me, I will be in search of a liquid soap that doesn't make me want to wretch everytime I use it 😂"

Thought I’d washed too many time yesterday, when my hands were red, with micro cuts at the end of day.  Testing today on rested skin and untouched skin resulted in Needle-like sensation, followed by red skin on both areas. Have not had such a bad reaction with Softsoap before."

I have an immunosuppressed child, and always have been a hand washer, even before CoVid. In the early days of this event, I came to Amazon just seeking to buy bulk soap, and migrated to yours. As a classroom teacher, I used so much soap and always have been behind the curve, treating my chapped hands, rubbed raw from constant washing. I realized this morning as I again washed to my favorite 20 second tune, enjoying the light scent of my Softsoap pump, that my hands really are soft after washing, no chafing, just happy bubbles. The product washes off cleanly without residue...this is the perfect soap of our times. I’m sending sets to all of my first line friends and I thank you again for this product. For those considering buying, I give this the highest praise. Buy some for yourself and put it in a care package for someone it will bless."
hand_soap,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079FV6PRH,20-Feb-20,DyannLynn,5,19,"I know it's only hand soap, but I have adored this scent for years! Hard to describe, but it truly emulates what I consider a fresh, crisp, clean aroma. So airy and pleasant; not flowery, artificial or overpowering in any way.  If anything, 'Fresh Breeze' is a tad too subtle - that's how much I enjoy this fragrance! Had a difficult time finding it at our local brick-and-mortars, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Another less obvious plus: factory packaged in a relatively thick, but compact box. Perfect for storing and tough enough to endure shipping sans damage / leakage - always a concern when purchasing online. (Can't count the number of compromised orders I've received due to poor packing. Are you listening, Amazon?) No worries here though. In short, thrilled with everything about this item!"
hand_soap,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079FV6PRH,6-May-20,Ron E.,5,15,"Soap. This is soap. I guess that I like this soap. I do not have any issues with this soap. I have used Softsoap products for many years. It is of the liquid variety that I wanted and came in a 6 pack for about the same price as I would find in a store. The scent is not my preference but is fine considering that it is soap (I'm more of a vanilla fan myself). In the face of the pandemic, though, I will not scoff at  the scent of an essential product that quickly became hard to find (thanks, hoarders). It is not the worst scent that I have had from the Softsoap brand and the rest of it is exactly what I expected...soap. I have used it daily since I received it and have not, to my knowledge, been infected with any diseases...therefore, I would assume that it works? If you can get it, you will not have to go to the store for a while as it came in a package of 6 and that was the most important part for me. Therefore, I give this a rating of soap. I would say good soap. Now I implore you, as part of the human race, to use soap multiple times per day, especially after using a restroom (you know who you are so don't make this awkward for the rest of us). This one, in my humble and decidedly unprofessional opinion, works. Soap."

Gentle on the skin; gets rid of oil buildup on skin. Item was not damaged in any way. They all came perfectly sealed and easy enough to open. Just twist the top, set it by the sink, done.

Hubby likes a soap to feel smooth and not dry his hands out since he refuses to wear hand cream and washes his hands all the time. However I like the heavy duty soaps like mechanics and farmers use that strip everything from my hands. In all fairness I often have grease, oil, or manure from chickens cows and horses on me so I like to feel “squeaky” clean. Now if I am still extra dirty I will use my farmers soap but for normal use and if I just do the morning feeding chores I use this soap. It still feels clean without drying out my hands. The only con is that the last oz doesn't pump. Completely wasted. I try to save it by adding water or saving them up and combining them which takes forever since the soap is thick and does “run” into another bottle easily. So I would like to see the pump get atleast a bit more out of the bottom. As you can see in my pictures it is a decent amount left in the bottom. Now my son has seen me add water to the last bit and it has become a fun project if he slips away to the bathroom to play with the soap and sink while Mommy is distracted. So fun times for me 🙄"

I wash my hands around 10-20 times a day with most being at 20 seconds, before and after I eat. I also made it a habit to wash my hands if I touch a common area. This is because I have roommates with children and it's flu/cold season. So you would think my hands would get pretty dry with all this washing but they're actually not and I'm not sick either! I also don't need to apply hand lotion as often as I would need with another soap brand. My only con is the condition of the products upon arrival. One of the bottles leaked and the other has a cracked spout so I would need to transfer them to another bottle that is safe to use. Other than that, it's the best bang for your buck!"

But with the Rona, it has for a while been extremely difficult to get Softsoap in the stores.  When this became available, I jumped on it.  Overall, the soap itself is fine.  Get your hands wet, apply soap, lather and wash.  Much more sanitary than sharing a bar of soap. The biggest issue I had was with this particular Fresh Breeze scent.  It was not a mild scent, and more of an extremely strong perfume like scent. So if you can overcome the scent, it's a really good value."

Kinda annoying that it has long strings of soap that don't want to let go of the pump when using, so that I end up with soap mess on the counter half the time. But whatever. It's soap, it helps me clean my hands, and my hands aren't dry and cracking from using dish soap like I was before."

I have a bottle in each of our bathrooms and one in the kitchen.  Each bottle contains 7.5oz of Softsoap.  I chose the clean aloe vera scent as its my favorite.  It doesn't just wash/clean our hands, it moisturizes as well which is especially important now that its winter and our hands are dry and chapped.  These bottles will last quite some time and the price can't be beat.  I do think when its time to order more Softsoap I will go ahead and order this same item-6 bottles rather than the large refill bottle.  These bottles are perfect for home/office/restaurant bathrooms, kitchens."

The aloe vera variety is one that makes me feel good and like I'm helping my  hands.  It refreshes my body and feels like I'm moisturizing.  When I got it, the price was pretty good.  Some sellers and different varieties  can be over priced.  Quite frankly, I have often been able to purchase Soft Soap for 99 cents a bottle from places like Safeway.  Buying online tends to be a more expensive proposition, so when I saw this group of 6 being offered for $5.94, I jumped on it, especially since it was available for subscribe and save which meant the cost was actually less.  I'll keep hoping to find some of my favorite other varieties offered at this same, reasonable price.  At any rate, I think it's a great product."

Though the scent is nice and light, seems more faint than normal and soft seems thinner and more watery than other soft soap I’ve used (even in this scent). Seems like a watered down product and dried out my hands."

I prefer to use soaps that don't have all these weird chemicals or dyes, because the soaps without chemicals or dyes seem to be very good to my hands.  I do not recommend this soap at all."

However, the earlier version, which had the same labels and even the same SKU number,  dispensed foam; while this just dispenses a glop of soap gel. And in fact the short video included with the photos shows it dispensing foam. I called Colgate-Palmolive to ask about this, and was told that the formulation was changed in 2019 to a non-foaming formulation. In my opinion, this should be made clear in the description; and the video showing it dispensing foam should be removed or replaced, to avoid the false impression that this dispenses foam."

Therefore, I had to wash the soap off of each bottle, which I should not have had to do.  The bottle that leaked was only half full when I received it. Also, as you can see from the picture, the pump on that bottle is broken, which means I will have to take the top off in order to use it, or wait until one of the other ones is empty and then use that top.  I realize this may not be a major issue, however the point is I should have received a full bottle with a pump that actually works, since that is what I paid for!

To be fair, usually that happens with most things when they're like, nearly empty, but I feel like it happens way too early here, and adding some water doesn't even help much...
