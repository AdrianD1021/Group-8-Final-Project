1000,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,20-Apr-20,Ms. Piklewhitz,3,52,"I ordered three boxes of these gloves. When the package originally arrived, we checked the boxes which did not look like they were tampered with. I had no issues with the first box (which is why I am giving three stars), and was almost finished with the second box (a few gloves at the bottom remaining). When I went to use a pair this morning, I discovered that one of the gloves in the box was stained with what looked like a translucent brown liquid that had dried! I threw the rest of the box out!!!!"
1001,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,18-Mar-20,Amazon Customer,2,44,"The gloves are all right, nothing impressive. But, the package arrived damage and the opening is broken. Was it on purpose? How could you crush an actual box this bad during delivery, when delivery bag seems fine but the product looks like someone teared it open. Very disappointed in the arrival condition would not buy again."
1002,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,18-Apr-20,Christine L.,1,38,"This is the worst product. These gloves rip just putting them on & they’re not even tight. I’m very disappointed. I won’t order them again. What’s the point of having gloves if they rip just putting them on. I buy a LOT of gloves, but I won’t buy these again. You have to be so so careful, I don’t want to risk them tearing while I need protection."
1003,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,26-Jul-19,Amazon Customer,1,40,Tears easily. Very thin.
1004,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,2-Apr-20,solomka20,1,26,"I got the gloves with a ripped up box. The outside package was perfectly fine so you can tell it was shipped that way. Since I need to wear them to stay safe from Corona, that doesn’t seem very safe."
1005,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,26-Mar-19,DietMJ,5,26,"I needed clear vinyl gloves for a cooking demo.  It's next to impossible to find them in the store- most don't fit well or come in odd colors.  I have small hands (ring size 4-5) and was concerned about the fit.  As some of the other reviews mentioned the gloves run a little small, I ordered size medium.  They were a perfect fit!  Worked well for food prep and held up to normal use.  Will order again whenever this large box runs out."
1006,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,27-Mar-20,Ziggy3339,5,19,"That said, they’re fine. I worked in an emergency room and always double glove for infectious diseases. Recommend you do that as well . These are not thick and durable in times when we are trying to practice staying away from the Ovid-19."
1007,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,25-Jul-19,GOD IS IN CONTROL,5,15,Great quality gloves for a great price. They are not thin and they don't easily tear like some other gloves that I have used in the past.
1008,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,24-Jul-20,Amazon Customer,1,6,I have a genetic immune disorder so I've been buying medical gloves for years. Usually I buy the blue nitrile ones but they were not available at the time. So I bought these instead. Total mistake. These gloves rip at the wrist every single time I put one on. Only buy these if you are extremely desperate. Appalling that companies can sell such subpar products for medical use. People with immune disorders should get prioritization like hospitals on medical supplies that we have needed for every day life before the pandemic and now even more so.
1009,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,18-Jul-20,E,1,7,"I have to use gloves for cleaning certain things regardless of covid and these are awful! I can't imagine these are really used in the medical profession. Maybe as a last resort, as in my case. These have some thickness but they rip at the wrist before you can get them all the way on because they have little ability to stretch. They are a bit skinny and the fingers are kind of long, they aren't a true size medium. If I get them on without ripping they almost always roll up around the wrist. I'm pretty annoyed at this purchase because not only are they worst gloves I've ever used, it's price gouging, I'm getting really sick of amazon allowing this on here."
1010,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,26-Sep-20,Brenda Rice,4,One,"These gloves are on the small side, simply because they do not stretch like nitrile gloves do. However, as long as your hands are totally dry and you slip them on slowly, carefully over the fingers first, then down your hand, they go on well. My husband and adult son are not fond of them because they break when they put them on; I have found them to go on well when I take the time as mentioned above. Yes, I have had a few break on that last pull over my palm but I usually take the time to do it carefully. I ordered more because they are more readily available and a few dollars less than nitrile. I am glad I ordered the medium size though; I have nitrile gloves in small that fit my hand nicely, but these in a small would not have worked at all. So, think about the sizing, one size up, because had I known this before and ordered the XL for my husband and adult son, they might work better for them. I like them for what I need, filling the gas tank, handling certain things from the store, going through the mail; just remember to order a size larger."
1011,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,14-Apr-21,Amazon Customer,5,,"Since 2020, my hands have been breaking out in a god awful rash. They start with tiny red itchy bumps, and end up with most of the hand/wrist being covered with severe redness/bumps, that often become flaky or crack and sometimes bleed. I’ve worked in a hospital for almost 9 years, so you can imagine the torture my hands went through, even more so with COVID. From my NP to a dermatologist, both thought my condition was either fungal infection or severe heat rash. I tried fungal, anti-itch, and steroid creams, along with specific creams for eczema and psoriasis- none of which which truly helped. Many months later (and a butt ton of money), I’ve discovered that I’m allergic to Nitrile gloves, which happens to be the only gloves my hospital uses because they’re generally powder and latex free. Since early this year, I’ve been using these gloves at work instead of the Nitrile gloves, and my hands have healed up tremendously! I’ve gone from looking like I’d dipped my hands in acid, to practically normal looking hands again. These gloves aren’t quite as durable as others and can easily rip if applying too much pressure with putting them on, so I went up to a size medium to avoid struggling with putting them on- easy fix! I don’t have a before and after photo of my hands, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. I’ll continue to repurchase these as they alone have saved my hands!!"
1012,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,30-Jul-20,Saliandra,1,2,"I have been frustrated trying to find decent gloves ever since Costco ran out of their gloves during COVID-19. The ones Costco carried were perfect with regard to size, and they are (were) sturdy and affordable. These particular gloves from Amazon are quite expensive, and the medium does not fit my hands like the medium size from Costco. Because they are a little on the tight side, getting them on my hands causes them to break with ease. They're just not very stretchy and I have to be very careful with them. And they develop tears fairly easily. I've been using them for painting, and find I need to throw them out and put on a new pair after a couple of hours. I guess I need to continue my search for a better glove. Sigh."
1013,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,23-Jan-21,SSAssa@aol.com,5,,"This is 2nd box we've used. Pros: 1. They do the job. 2.  Didn't tear. Cons: Sizing inaccurate -- please see below. Comments: 1. First box was large & fit a male with medium-large size hands, but difficulty getting on & off.  This was likely attributable to the fact that they're vinyl (with inherently little stretch) and powder-less, all as expected.  One shouldn't expect anything different than what one ordered. 2. Second box was for female with TINY hands , conventionally wearing size XS (or small if gloves run tight).  Based on reader reviews, ordered medium and sure glad we did!  While there's room to spare at fingertips & a bit elsewhere, clearly the small would either not fit or be challenging (and therefore tear) if we selected small. 3. Because one must oversize and have room to spare, due to the nature of vinyl, we do NOT recommend vinyl for tasks that require fine detail or good touch sensation.  But this is the nature of the beast, NOT a problem for this glove. Thanks to prior reviewers, and hope this info helps someone else!"
1014,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,14-Nov-20,Kristi Ambrose,2,,"I bought these because my mom came home from surgery and I needed a LOT of gloves.  A few issues. 1- I never actually realized I was allergic to latex, but apparently I am.  The box kind of fools you because it says latex free but if you look at it closely it says something about how its ""components"" are latex (whatever the words they used, there is Latex in these gloves).  My hands have gotten extremely itchy, red, lots of bumps, etc.  All in all:  I hate these gloves. 2- They rip and they rip often.  If you think you're getting these ""inexpensive"" gloves and ""wow look there's so many inside!""  They probably give you so many because they rip so often, usually right around the palm area or right at the wrist.  And yes I bought the right size. 3-  Super duper thin.  Think deli gloves. The really sucky thing?  I bought this box and my medical supply center sent me the same exact ones in another box lol.  So now I am stuck with 2 boxes of these sucky gloves lol."
1015,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,16-Jun-20,sf36867,1,4,"These gloves were great when I bought them before. I have always used vinyl gloves around the house for various chores --anything handling raw meat, gardening in dirt, to cleaning the cat litter box. I bought and received these last March, but now the price is more than double."
1016,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,27-Mar-20,CMM,1,8,"This product came in a torn box and the writing on the box has misspelling of common words which makes me think that this manufacturer didn't even take the time to spell check product packaging they are sending to America.  Makes me suspicious of the quality of these gloves.  Not being paranoid, but they are, of course, from China.  Leads me to think they are not what they say - being protective to use during the Covid19 epidemic.  Anyone else notice this? anyone else got a torn box?"
1017,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,15-Jun-19,Louie Chen,4,6,Use it for cleaning job at home daily. It is a good gloves either it’s price or quality but the only thing that I don’t like is the water could permeate easy .
1018,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,3-Sep-20,Jacqueline C,5,2,"So before ordering I read some of the reviews and the majority were saying to size up because they were too small. Regular “one size fits all” gloves are always way too big on me, I have small hands. So I figured I would size up to a medium (normally I’d think to order small) and these medium are the sizes of one size fits all, they are too loose on me. I like to use these while cooking and these started sliding off, I need to order another set in small or I’ll have to use rubber bands at the wrists everytime to make sure they don’t move around. So just size normal, don’t size up."
1019,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,23-Jun-20,S. Jackson,1,5,Extremely thin and low quality. Breaks just trying to put these on!
1020,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,2-Jan-21,Discipula Noctis,5,,"COVID purchase. I wanted some inexpensive gloves for shopping trips, and to protect my hands from all the disinfectant wipes and sprays I'm using these days, and for when I'm loading ""contaminated"" laundry into the washer. I also use disposable gloves to clean up after the pets and handle raw meat and fish. They've served well. I also use nitrile gloves for certain tasks, and for work at my retail job. Using the cheaper vinyl gloves for quick jobs that don't require touch sensitivity helps me conserve the more expensive nitrile gloves for jobs that do. For those who haven't used vinyl gloves: They will fit much more loosely than a nitrile glove of the same size. They tend to cling to your fingernails and eventually (depending on use) start tearing where the nails poke through. Any chunky jewelry will tear them. Pulling them on too hard or with wet hands will tear them, as with disposable gloves of other materials."
1021,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,16-Sep-20,Kandelina,1,One,"These are very cheap gloves, they rip as you are putting them on and if you have finger nails (normal, nothing extravagant) they will rip through the holes. I bought them for my soap making and keeping everything sanitary but these are so thin, it isn’t worth it. I just bought a box of nitrile gloves that Ive used before and they are much tougher. I should have just stuck with those since the price is comparable. Now I have a box of gloves that can’t be used. The size isn’t true to fit either, hence the ripping when trying to get them on. Got a medium which my hand fits fine in other brands and these are probably best for small hands."
1022,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,25-Nov-20,couch potato,3,,"I like the gloves. They serve their purpose. But I must say they are way overpriced for a supposedly inexpensive disposable glove. These are the same gloves I used to buy in the 99 cent store for $1.59 before the pandemic. And that was kind of  high price considering the store is named the 99 cent store. That's back when I just used them for cleaning and cooking. Now I used them when I go shopping at the supermarket, pharmacy, etc. in addition to cleaning and cooking. Now they are $9.99 in the 99 cent store which is way too high and $17.99 on Amazon which is way, way too high."
1023,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,4-Apr-21,Jessica,4,,"I have small hands, and whenever I buy food prep gloves I always get small or small/medium. I purchased the medium thinking my husband could use them if needed and squeeze into them, but they are tight on my hands. There’s no way he could use these too. Get a size larger than what you’re used too. Like any vinyl gloves they’re pretty durable, but they will tear if you are not careful enough with them when aggressively cleaning that stubborn stain - that’s with any other vinyl gloves I’ve used in the past. Sometimes you need to double up on them."
1024,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,12-Mar-21,Grandma Candy,1,,Returned the vinyl gloves for nitrile gloves from the same manufacturer.  The vinyl gloves tore every time I put one on to use it and it wasn't because of the size.  They just weren't good quality in my opinion. After three torn gloves in a row I decided to exchange them for the ones I was familiar with - MedPrice Nitrile Gloves.  The handling of the return and replacement was fantastic; couldn't be happier with the service and am very pleased with the nitrile gloves.  There is quite a big difference in price from vinyl to nitrile but well worth it for sanitary reasons.
1025,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,17-Feb-21,Susan White,4,,"I usually get latex free medical gloves that stretch more. I thought I would try these. I am a woman with fairly large narrow hands, Medium Fit very close to fit of Medium Medical gloves. The fit is very good with short or long nails. They stay put! Work great for gripping things! Thick & strong but flexible. Excellent with phone or tablet... a real bonus for me. I can wash them while on my hands or use hand sanitizer when touching surfaces outside my house to keep from transfer/cross contamination. So one pair can keep me safe all day, then toss away! Very happy with my purchase."
1026,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,14-Nov-20,Ryan,1,One,"Firstly they fit my hand perfectly but godforbid you move too quickly they will rip at the base before you even slip your hand in. Now, if your working with corrisives then forget it these things have the worst grade of plastic and the thickness can only be measured in picometre. They melt like butter in the microwave if in contact with any strong acid or base. Any type of temperature increase, not even an open flame but warm table top. I am sure you can probably guess the outcome. Stuck plastic to any warm surface. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1027,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,6-Dec-20,Ruth F.,5,,"During the covid pandemic I have been very glad to have these gloves available especially for the price. I use these gloves to take care of my teenage autistic daughter who needs help with daily living skills. Sometimes they do break and don't have the flexibility of higher end gloves that you would find in a professional health care setting. With that being said, use them accordingly depending upon your needs but be aware that  you might need something different when working with clients for safety."
1028,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,13-Apr-20,Yosel,1,6,It breaks easily.
1029,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,22-Feb-21,Giovanna Z.,3,,"Unfortunately these gloves tear easily. I use gloves a lot when I do different paint-resin-wood crafts/projects, so when I had to purchase another box, I liked these because of the price.  I got Medium and they run a little small and start to tear when trying to pull them on.  Once you've got them on, they serve their purpose with small projects, but if you have to wash your paintbrushes, you'll find yourself with a torn fingertip or two. They also leave a sour ""after-smell"" on your hands like mildew."
1030,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,6-Jul-20,inthelight,5,One,These work for me and keep my hands clean while shopping groceries or filling up with gas at those two nasty places.  Then I just rip them off and wash my hands. I even use them to wash my vegetables with diluted vinegar a natural disinfectant then I take them off and trash them.  Works very good for me.
1031,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,20-Feb-21,Artzy,5,,"I wear disposable gloves when taking public transportation which isn't very often these days. I've only worn two pairs of this brand so far so I can't really rate them properly at this point. I am an older female with chubby hands. I can't wear a small size so the medium are perfect for me... just a little on the loose side so they are easy to put on and take off. They are a good thickness but easy to pick up small objects and use a camera. So far, so good!"
1032,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,26-Mar-21,Patricia A. Williams,1,,"These gloves are the worst gloves made during this Pandemic and they should be ashamed of themselves! A medium was too small. But my hands aren't large. They didn last one dish washing! And yes, I wash my dishes, it's only me! The fingers were too short and the tips always broke. I kept them because I have skin issues and must keep my hands covered with WELL MADE GLOVES when using my hands! These were the only gloves left on the shelves. I had no choice. They offered a return but I needed something to protect my hands."
1033,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,31-Mar-20,T. harm,1,6,These gloves rip as soon as you put them on.  Very poor quality.
1034,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,12-Sep-20,Pen Name,2,,Well I can honestly say that I wasn’t too pleased with these gloves. I’ve ordered several from different vendors and these have been the worst yet. I would Like to return them but I just don’t feel like going through the  trouble for a little money. I’m not sure if it’s because they run small that they rip at the top when you’re trying to pull them up or they’re just not thick enough. I ordered medium I wish I would’ve ordered possibly a large but as I said too much trouble to return. I would not order these again. Maybe my review would’ve been different if I would’ve ordered a different size.
1035,disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,2-Sep-20,DLux,3,,"These are more like food handler gloves (thin); my box had about 5 defective or stained gloves in it (had holes or were discolored brownish orange stained).  If your hand has any moisture on it, it is VERY hard to get them on.  The bottom of the glove had torn several times while we were trying to put them on.  If your using them to cook, they should be okay but if you need to wear them out... get a different kind."

I don’t think it was worth the price, but it was a necessary buy. I think because of the virus, they are Price gouging. However, it seems to be the best price I could find on here. Although there was a box that was a dollar cheaper but I chose these because of the medical company and  the description!! , That’s just what we needed. They work great."

Huffman,1,One,"These gloves have good reviews, but as with all things in our economic system I expect these are outsourced to different firms that have wildly divergent quality control. We bough two boxes, and the ones we got are horrible. I normally fit medium, but these are much too small. For bad sizing I would normally ding a product just a start or two. But the quality of these gloves i also terrible. My wife, who can wear them, has to be very careful not to tear them just putting them on; never mind doing actual work with them. Go ahead and buy them if you like playing roulette. But if you want a 100% guarantee you'll get decent gloves, look elsewhere."

They are not nearly as flexible as the nitrile purple ones from the same company.  They are out of stock right now, so I ordered the clear ones.  I'll use them to clean up messes from my kittens, but will not purchase them again.  Hopefully, the purple ones will become available again."

They are thinner than most other latex gloves and rip easily. 2. Fit is poor as compared to others - tight in the fingers and then loose around the wrist. Hope this helps!
