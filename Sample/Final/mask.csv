0,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,23-Sep-20,Ann B,5,929,"These SUDILO Disposable Protective Black Masks are Attractive, Fit Well, and have a 3 ply filter. This mask can filter Haze, Dust, Carbinol, Spatter, and Stink.. It also has an adjustable nose clip, and very comfortable ear loops."
1,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,30-Dec-20,Layla Simons,5,335,I work on an ambulance and we are required to always wear masks right now even when we don’t have patients. I wanted something thinner than an N-95 for non-patient care times and something more breathable but effective. We have regular surgical masks but the fibers are always tickling my nose so I ordered these. They are very breathable but thick enough that I would say they provide good protection. They look nice and the material holds up for multiples uses. There’s also no fibers tickling my nose. I definitely recommend these for just every day use during this pandemic whether you’re a healthcare provider or anyone else.
2,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Sep-20,Lyn,5,333,"The black masks come in a box of 50 for your daily needs. They are disposable, but thick enough and well made to get more than one use from them. They fit well over your chin and they are adjustable for a snug fit over the nose, giving them a fog free fit for glasses when adjusted properly."
3,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Sep-20,Darla Mae Bertelle,5,294,These masks are super easy to breath in. I like that they dont form close to your mouth. Definitely recommend these!
4,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Oct-20,Joseph Malinowski,5,194,"When I first bought masks in April I paid $10.00 for 10 masks. This price was wonderful. They are as comfortable as any other mask. I bought these for my kids and I. So no matter what, we have enough. I also love the color."
5,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,17-Oct-20,dr awesome,5,188,"These do the job, have ordered two sets now for the pandemic. They do make your lips feel a little waxy but they are thick so I know I’m not sharing germs. Kids love the Black color instead of the blue so it’s worth it!"
6,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,12-Nov-20,squaits,5,262,"I had never used a disposable mask before, mostly because I hated the look of the blue ones and because they are not environmentally friendly. However, I needed to purchase a breathable, disposable mask to wear for an extended period of time and was delighted to find an all-black option. This mask is very comfortable, lightweight, and easily stretches to fit my large head. Typically masks pull on my ears or are too tight around my mouth, but this easily fit around my face and left plenty of room to open fully. The fact that it is such a large pack of masks is great, because I will be stocked up for a long time. I even shared some with family who I thought could use a more fashionable option. I would definitely recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a better option than the standard medical blue masks."
7,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,18-Dec-20,Alex Chaney,5,246,"I have to wear a mask at work and was tired of the blue medical look so I ordered these black ones.  These are multilayered masks, I have cut one open to see, with a finer screen in between the two more open pieces. Pros: Wire insert in nose piece.  That helps cut down on my glasses fogging. I can get free masks at work but they use a plastic insert and my glasses fog terribly when I try that mask. The mask is has been a good quality.  I have been trough most of a box with no ear loop failures. It is a layered mask which is required where I work. Not blue Cons:  I need a larger mask and I haven't found one yet in any brand.  At the end of the day I am beyond ready to take it off because of the tugging on my ears.  I will often use a mask keeper to hold the mask instead of using the ear loops on my ears. I have a few boxes of other masks that i have purchased because of the price but I would buy these again at 3-4x the price."
8,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,1,18,"Mask is lightweight and comfortable if you are using it for a day or less. Also if you don’t touch it too much or keep having to take it off and putting it back on several times during the day. If you’re like me and need to be putting the mask on and taking it off several times during the day, you will notice that it starts to deteriorate after a few hours of usage. After wearing it for a bit, the quality starts to worsen and little clothing fibers start to lift from the mask which makes it extremely itchy and uncomfortable. Additionally, the bands are not too stretchy; they rip break/rip way too easily. The good thing is that it’s easy to tie a knot and repair the band. My head is usually smaller than the average persons so the fact that it rips so easy should be concerning for people with bigger heads."
9,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Dec-20,Linda Horseman,1,19,Purchased based on the good reviews. These masks have very small loose fibers that feel like there is a hair in your nose.  I only wear disposable masks and have purchased different brands. These are the first that have had this issue.
10,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Jan-21,Jessgeee,1,14,"This mask is sleek and nice . Better than wearing a blue disposable mask ,but it Sheds to much on the outside and you can it feel it inside your nose. The material making your nose itchy . Save your money and buy them somewhere else"
11,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Jan-21,Ivan,1,11,These masks are by far the worst I’ve had. The masks arrived with a strong chemical smell like burnt plastic. I was suspicious and after just a couple of wears my face started breaking out in a rash and I’ve never experienced anything like it. I’m afraid to wear them now. The material is also very thin and the woven material started falling apart on the first wear. The one nice thing about them is that they cover a good amount of face but I wouldn’t recommend them after my purchase.
12,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,7-Feb-21,Ella,1,11,"Loved this mask at first. I’m always wearing black so I felt like this was a must have. Also disposable masks are a tad bit easier to breath in so I said win win. After a week of wearing them I started to notice my breathing was acting a little weird.. the only new thing was the mask since I needed it for work. I’m not 100% sure what they use to make these masks but something ain’t right. Went back to my normal mask and I felt better In just one day of not wearing these disposable masks. Also quick note , I often wore the regular blue disposable masks and I never had an issue till I tried these. I know a lot of people who still wear them , maybe I was just allergic to something in it but I don’t personally recommend."
13,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Jan-21,Angela,1,11,"This mask is comfortable around the ears and fits well however it ends up with ""fuzzies"" on the inside and you constantly feel like you have to remove something from your lips/mouth area. Won't buy this kind again.  Also the straps break easily. These are Garbage."
14,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,26-Dec-20,Adam,1,9,I have broken like 10 of these in 2 days. I am not even kidding. The ear loops have terrible connection to the mask itself. Lie its being help with freaking stick glue lol. Try a dif brand if I were you.
15,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Jan-21,Jacob Sanchez,1,9,"Appearance and style is a 5 star, presentation is really good, but the quality would be Zero stars if i could leave that! The very first one i put on lasted literally 5 minutes, at first it felt great, but as soon as i went to adjust it, and lightly i might add, it popped very easy, so i thought maybe a put on a defective one, so i put on the second one... boom popped in a few minutes again. The third one lasted little longer over an hour, i was like ""forget it"". VERY POOR QUALITY! Don't waste your money. WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN!"
16,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Feb-21,Chris Fullerton,1,7,"Not what you see in the picture. Single ply, will make your glasses fog up and THEY SMELL LIKE PAINT. Wore one of these for a full day and began to get nauseous. Amazon should pull this product from their site. Most likely carcinogenic and made in China. On the other hand, you might get a little head high from the paint fumes that they dyed them with, so if that's a plus, might want to buy these!"
17,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Oct-20,DM decor,2,11,"Very disappointed with these mask! They arrived in a beat up box, the packaging was broken and they are super THIN!!! Don’t bother ordering these! I trash them IMMEDIATELY!!"
18,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Nov-20,Cricut crafter,5,231,"These masks are super comfortable to wear. I like the black because it doesn’t get discolored from my makeup. Also doesn’t rub all of my makeup off, just very little. Also my face doesn’t get steamy and feel moist after wearing for long periods, worn for up to 10 hours at work. I like the throw away masks because they seem cleaner than reusable masks that probably aren’t washed often enough. I like to put a stack of these masks in my car and have in case someone in my family forgets their mask at home. Definitely would recommend!"
19,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Dec-20,Sherndina Moreland,3,8,"This mask has a chemical order, very off putting. I do like the black color. As comfortable behind ears, as the blue stretchy mask everyone is wearing, but the material is somewhat stiff. I placed  them on hangers in the garage to air out...still smell the oder  in my room, where I opened the box. Will not order again due to chemical smell and stiffness of material.  Small note inside said manufactured in China."
20,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Jan-21,My Aun Lia,2,6,"Firstly, I purchased theses masks because I wanted disposable black masks. I use the standard blue on a daily basis but I wanted black to stand out a bit. The masks are relatively nice, generally... but the material becomes fuzzy very quickly. It was worn just during daily routine but the fuzz from the material continually irritated my nose and mouth. I got another mask and it did the same thing almost instantly, another mask and same problem.... Basically, the moment a new mask is opened and stretched to place on your face the material instantly becomes looser and fuzzes. Its as if the mask material is missing a layer of protectant over the fabric. I do not recommend these masks to wear for longer than 20 minutes maximum because if you remove the mask and return it to your face the material becomes unbearable. Because of that, I do not recommend and I would not order again."
21,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Dec-20,Pa3cya,1,7,This is falsely described. This is most definitely 1 ply. I bought this black one and a box of 50 purple masks from a different company together. Right away I saw the box with the purple masks is much bigger. Right away I can feel that the black mask was like a cheap paper napkin. Then I decided to try it on and I could see through it. Returned it right away.
22,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Nov-20,Kawaiimami,1,6,I’ve bought every kind on face mask/ shield possible since the pandemic started. These particular ones are the worst. Not only are the really big and uncomfortable. It literally had this weird scent. Not strong but still every time I breathed I would smell it. The first one I pulled out of the bag broke (explains why they give so many) also after wearing all day my ears were hurting. It was so big there is gaping in the side of my face . I also never had trouble breathing comfortably in other masks but this one made my face feel hot. One star for the black color.
23,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,26-Dec-20,Yuval Romer,1,8,Look good but Not good quality. The inner lining comes apart and becomes like fuzz and is uncomfortable to breathe. Lining comes off and the fuzz goes into nose And mouth: it is also itchy
24,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Nov-20,Ray,4,7,The product is ok but not worth the extra money. I ordered the box of 50 mask. I’ve used about 20 of them. The face covering its self works as described. My issue is with the straps. Out of the 20 mask that I’ve used. The straps broke on 8 of them within the first couple of hours using them. I like most people spend the extra money thinking they were of better quality. They’re not.
25,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Nov-20,Dani O,5,15,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on masks since the covid pandemic started. Shopped Etsy, facebook ads, instagram ads and online search ads. I have severe ""mask Claustrophobia"", yep I guess it's a thing due to lack of breathability. These highly affordable masks are the best I have bought and affordable. You can breath in air easily and they still pass the not being able to blow out a candle hack which means they are protecting you. This is the only mask I will use from now on. Fit myself and husband. Would be to big for a child in my opinion. Hope this helps anymore who was having the same problem as myself of not being able to breath in your mask."
26,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,6-Oct-20,Anna,2,7,"I purchased these masks because I got tired of wearing blue masks. I purchased these masks specifically because they are black. I was pleasantly surprised. They are thick, and the elastic does not break like some of the other.  They are actually great quality and very complimenting when you want more than just the hospital blue masks. They are also very thick and appears to be great for protection. Highly recommend these. ***originally rated this a 5 but not changing it to a 2 since a couple of them the string broke. I will be returning.***"
27,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Oct-20,Jon,1,8,"These masks are way overpriced for the quality you get, they are very uncomfortable and the elastic strap breaks very easily, making it so you need to carry multiple masks just in case. This is a 5 dollar box of masks that are 3x the price they should be, due simply to demand. Get another brand of black mask!"
28,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,5,"In the photo it looks as though these have the soft, breathable comfy white inner lining. They do not! The same waxy black material is on both sides. For this reason alone they are uncomfortable & less breathable. Worse still, they have a bad smell, like whatever plastic or glues used to make them are still off-gassing. I work in an industry where we're careful about exposing ourselves to chemicals, and this is a chemical smell of some kind possibly containing VOCs. the worst thing you could breathe through all day.  DO NOT BUY"
29,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Feb-21,IG,1,2,"I realize the item description says ""disposable"" but that usually means when you are done wearing it at the end of the day. The slightest movement of the mask, such as lifting it to get a drink of water, not to mention if you remove it to eat, causes the strap to become dislodged. Unless you have an extra in your pocket you must hold the mask to your face until you can obtain a replacement. After the first time it happened I became very cautious with any movement while using these masks. It has happened several more times no matter how careful I was. If you do not plan on moving it for any reason during the entire time you are wearing it the mask will meet your needs. However, if you need to remove it, or even just lift it partially off you face, make sure you have access to a replacement mask. I have used other masks and never experienced this repeated problem."
30,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Dec-20,Alyse,3,3,"Although in terms of comfort, light weight and stretch parameters, this mask has five stars in all, it’s not an efficient mask for Covid purposes. It has pretty much no filter and all it really does is prevent the spread of any liquids such as sneezing or coughing particles. It’s pretty thin like any standard complimentary mask that you might get if you go into a airport or supermarket. The mask isn’t double lined so there’s not a thicker inside portion where you clearly are meant to put it against your mouth because it can prevent anything from outside sleeping in. If you’re looking for a mask that has a good filter and will actually prevent the small air particles that the virus can actually travel through, I recommend an N95. The mask is pretty much reversible whereas if you flip it inside out it’s gonna look the same and that’s not really what I was expecting from this but, I also bought it just because I like the color and wanted black masks."
31,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Dec-20,Kristie,2,3,"I was shopping for disposable black mask. I thought I was getting a decent Black Friday deal. I ordered three boxes. They arrived in about week. The ear bands are soft and stretchy, overall the mask are comfortable for SHORT time use. However, these mask are falsely advertised, they definitely are not 3 ply! I wear glasses and bending the thin wire over my nose and trying to adjust the mask regular breathing still fogs up my glasses.  Also, after wearing a mask for a couple of hours it does become fuzzy on the inside. Which is super annoying. I'm not going to mess with returning them but I would not order again. I do not recommended this brand of mask."
32,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,23-Feb-21,loren calevro,4,One,"Bought these masks to keep in my purse and car for all the times we forget to take a reusable masks with us or someone loses theirs. I like that they are black...since masks have pretty much become an ""accessory"" at this point. They just look ""nicer"" than the typical blue ones. They are comfortable, light weight, have the wire pinch nose and fit everyone in the house from my 13 year old son to my 41 year old husband. We all pretty much prefer them to our reusables. My boxes arrived in good condition and properly sealed. First time I pulled one out I thought ""man, this thing smells like pot!"" but maybe it was in my head....A While later my husband needed to use one and asked me "" is it just me or do these masks smell like pot?!"" So ok....not just in MY head. Then I went to a restaurant and our waitresses strap broke on her mask and I offered her one out of the sealed bag in my purse  and before we left she pulled me aside and said "" no judgement, but wanted to let you know that if you have pot in your purse it is making the masks smell like it!"" I bought two boxes and haven't opened the second yet to see if it's the same deal....but thought I would put it out there incase this is a regular thing and you wouldn't be down with people thinking you spend your days clam baking your masks!"
33,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,7-Feb-21,dsgyt,1,6,Was so excited to get these but even after airing them out for a couple of days- the chemical smell was super strong. Concerned about the toxicity of that smell right in your nasal cavity... no thanks.
34,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Nov-20,Mac,1,5,"Every single mask has broken. The ear loops are held on by nothing apparently because EVERY ONE has broken. Either when I put it on or if I took it off and then put it back on, the second time it breaks. Ridiculous. Would not buy again."
35,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,20-Dec-20,John H Wright,5,36,"Nice large size with a pretty sturdy metal wire for pinching against the top of your nose, so no threat of the masks falling and exposing the nose, which would defy the point of wearing one. Came with two huge packs within the box. Breathable material, and, if aesthetics are important to you, these black ones are comparatively attractive! Definitely nicer than the blue ones, and more hygienic than the stifling reusable cloth masks that everyone's aunt seems to be making these days. For whoever said the pleats go the wrong way....turn it around. Literally, just....flip the mask around lol. Not exactly rocket science. Considering the price, too, I would definitely recommend these, as long as you're not particularly petite, as they do provide a considerably larger coverage than many others I've seen."
36,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Jan-21,David W. Fowell,5,49,"Finally, the first time I get a face mask that is very comfortable and the metal nose band works very well. I can breathe without fogging up my glasses or at least VERY little. They are very soft. Made from a (now get this) nonwoven, meltblown material, hows that! What ever it means it means it's soft and very comfortable and your face doesn't feel like it's in a sauna. In the description it isn't mentioned that the company rates their bacterial filtration efficiency greater than 95% and the company rates suitable for medical use, which I take it to mean medical offices. Very forthcoming I think. For what they appear to be ( unless told differently) getting fifty masks for what I was charged is a bargin. Yes I highly recommend them."
37,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Feb-21,V. Sofia,1,3,"Yeah it is nice looking, comfortable and all that but the strings detach with minimal stretch to put on. My wife and I both has the same experience and no our heads are not large. I’ve never had a mask detach so easily from the strings that wrap around your ear. I had to tie one end around my glasses to keep it on at the doctors office. Look elsewhere."
38,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Nov-20,Elio,1,3,"Update: These masks were so great that I ordered a second box. However, not one single mask had a nose piece in the right place. Some didn’t have any at all. I am really disappointed. Original: They stretch great. They're not too tight on the face, nose or ears. I wear these to the gym and honestly started wearing them wherever I go and have stopped using my other masks as soon as I tried these on. 10/10 would recommend."
39,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,30-Nov-20,Kelly,5,12,"I had been wearing the traditional blue surgical face masks for several months, and after needing a new supply, decided to try these. These have a sturdier and thicker feel to them than the usual blue ones, and don't tear easy like I found that other type did. The most important part for me was how well they could perform when working out and breathing heavy. The regular blue masks would suck inwards towards the nose and mouth, leading to that dreaded panic attack feeling and like you can't get enough air. These masks fit well and stay put, without being sucked towards the face even during a rigorous workout on the treadmill. They haven't felt irritating, and I don't have to adjust them while wearing them even after a long while. I can breathe very freely and easily in them, and no more panicky feeling while wearing a mask!"
40,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,31-Jan-21,Bob,1,3,"The first mask I wore fell off while shopping at Costco. The ear loop detached. Luckily I had a pen with me and poked a hole where the loop attaches and fed it through and tied it off. When I got home I took the next mask from the box and with a slight tug the ear loop detached. It doesn't rip the material, it just comes off. I tried a 3rd mask and that one seems to be ok. I've not needed to dig further, and admit 3 masks is not a good statistical sample, but the first 2 out of 3 masks being defective is not a good sign. I will not buy again."
41,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Dec-20,GVM,1,3,The biggest problem I have with these is that they sort of migrate around your face and you need to pull them back into place which is obviously not what you want. They also feel just slightly too small and a little itchy. Honestly we probably aren’t going to use them unless maybeeeee under another mask
42,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Dec-20,Daren F.,4,2,"I bought these because I hated the way the blue masks look. I like that the black goes well with everything and I don't look like I'm getting ready to perform a procedure anymore. I am giving 4 stars because the first set I got had a odd almost moldy smell so I contacted amazon and they were quick to send a replacement. The masks fits well and is easy to breathe in, material feels strong and it is not too rough on the skin. I will definitely be buying more of these."
43,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Feb-21,Leanne,1,4,"These are AWFUL!! My face was SO itchy 😩 they are extremely linty and fuzzy...sonot feels like your fuzzes are going down your throat, which they actually are because when you breath in they do...Within minutes I had splotches all over my face and it felt puffy. My husband and kids had the same reaction. I thot black masks would be a better look then the blue medical ones but these are SO SO awful!!"
44,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Nov-20,Marco Martinez,1,6,Okay mask if you’re only going in and out of the store quickly. Any longer and the inside fibers become frayed and essentially irritate your face. Might as well not have a mask on when every 30 seconds you have to take it off and rub your nose. Becomes unbearably itchy after about 30 minutes of use.
45,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Dec-20,Kindle Customer,4,2,"Just got these. The color and quality great. The issue is I have a small sized face and they are too big. I can certainly use these over my cloth masks, I hope, or will use for guests. Another issue, my son has a wide face with a beard. These don't work that great for him either. Fits fine but as soon as he talks and moves his face, with his beard, they ride up his face. So these are definitely for an average  to larger face but careful for those with thicker beards."
46,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,13-Apr-21,kmurph31,5,,Basically this is one of the best purchases that I have ever made on Amazon.  There are fifty face masks that come in a box that are a one time wear and easy to dispose of.  It is a real bargain to receive 50 black masks for approximately thirteen dollars.  These masks can save your life by wearing them with a face shield that you can also purchase from Amazon for around the same price.  Wearing a face mask is not a political statement.  Wearing a mask can literally save your life and is the most effective way not to catch Covid19 besides being vaccinated.  I just got my one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine last Saturday.  I will continue to wear these affordable and effective face masks with my face shield until the whole USA is vaccinated.  The best bargain for your health that you can benefit for your money and your health.  Stay safe and buy these masks.
47,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Dec-20,Niloc0,1,3,"These are straight up garbage. The elastic pulls out of the mask when trying to put them on, they break immediately Unusable. I've used other inexpensive disposable masks and they've been fine, avoid this brand."
48,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Mar-21,M. D. Chambers,5,,"Over the last year I have been trying to find a facemask that would stand up to intense workouts, without success. Even masks supposedly designed for exercising fell short. If it wasn't sucking in the fabric while breathing heavy, then it was the bottom half of my face sitting in a pool of sweat with nowhere for it to go, or my glasses fogging up because the fit wasn't secure. Someone at my gym recommended these masks. This was money well spent.  The masks are lightweight, which helps most of the sweat evaporate quickly.  The fit is very secure over the bridge of my nose so no more fogged glasses. And the folds of the masks face outward so no more sucking in fabric while pushing through that last mile. I liked these so much that I've ordered 2 more boxes so I have a steady supply for the months to come. Highly recommended."
49,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,31-Mar-21,Bob Fam,5,,"These have been the best go to masks for me through this pandemic. I can breath in them and they don’t make me look like I have bird beak. They are affordable! They are light weight, yet durable, breathable, doesn’t leave lines under my eyes to create wrinkles on my face, the position is adjustable at the nose to be high or lower on my face as I wish to wear it. Doesn’t pull tug or hurt my ears yet stays on and doesn’t fall or droop. I love the simplicity of the black color and the ear loops are black too so they match and it tends to match whatever I wear. They are disposable however they’re made well enough to use more than once, I get several wears out of one but there are many in a box so you can throw away as you feel you are exposed or need to dispose of them. My favorite go to mask of 2020-2021."

Picture 2: My friend's home-made mask from Taiwan. Outer layer is the same material. Inner layer is cotton as an open pocket to insert or drape-over another disposable protection sheet for extra protection and comfort.
51,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,4-Apr-21,DB,1,,"After wearing this mask and noticing a tickle in my throat and fibers sticking to my shaved face, I drew instant concerns about the fibers in this mask being taken into your nasal passages and inhaled your lungs. I decided to put the masks under microscope at 60xs magnification. I found some other strange things about these masks, as you can see in my photos, there appears to be some sort of fluid or chemical on portions of the mask. I tested two brand new, never used masks from the box, both having the same patterns all over the mask. Unsure what this is, but if you want to breathe in synthetic fibers along with whatever this substance may be, be my guest. I personally, would not trust this mask and I’ve thrown away the two boxes which I purchased for my third grade-teaching wife."
52,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Jan-21,Maddy,1,2,"I read the reviews and they seemed promising. Upon opening the box of masks they looked normal and when initially wearing one it seemed comfortable, fast-forward to 1 hr, and the mask is wet from within. They are NOT breathable and are NOT absorbent. I had to take it off and run it under a hand dryer to dry it off. It was NASTY, and no, I am not a mouth breather nor was I talking while wearing the mask. They also gave me an allergic reaction on my chin. Definitely;y would NOT recommend these."
53,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,5-Apr-21,Ryan B.,5,One,"If your looking for a mask other than blue than you’ve found it haha I want to say about this mask are lightweight, you can definitely breathe in it and it’ll keep you safe if worn properly with the loops. I think that this 50pk is definitely worth it and it’s also enough for the family. The mask is evenly distributed to cover the nose and mouth. I did notice that on these masks that the loops don’t break off the mask itself unlike other masks that I’ve had. I consider these masks heavy duty! If your a man/woman and want to set that stylish side I’d recommend this to go with any outfit of the day."

Bertrand,4,One,"Generally, my workplace issues  masks to everyone upon entrance, but unfortunately after a couple of hours wearing them, the fibers will start breaking, and you end up breathing them into your lung. In order to remedy this situation, I have decided to purchase my own mask. Buying clothes masks was not an option, due to shrinkage  stress after a single wash. I took my chances on this on, and they are not too bad, and can  easily last up to 5 hours unless you are perspiring a lot."
55,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,22-Feb-21,Stephanie,5,,"I bought these because the hospital I work at requires everyone in patient care to wear surgical masks, and if I'm gonna wear a surgical mask then I'm gonna wear a black one lol I have a fat face and a big head and they fit me perfectly! I wear 2 because I feel more safe that way and they still fit just fine. They're good quality and not thin like others. They also didn't smell, which I know is a common occurrence when buying surgical masks online. Shipped very fast! I'll definitely buy these again when I run out! For transparency- I did get a card with my order linking me to their website and it said I would get a $5 Amazon gift card if I left a review, but it did NOT say the review had to be positive. These are purely my own views."

These were thicker than expected and as a result, my face gets really hot and sweaty. The only use was entry into the building so I chin diapered it the rest of the time. Also, they gave off an odor of parchment and sweat from cheap labor."
58,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,12-Dec-20,felix_s,3,One,"They have an industrial smell and feel like they're using the typical cheap material. I don't know if they are 3-ply but the other masks I bought in January that claimed to be 3-ply felt as thin as these. These do not feel as sturdy or well constructed as the ones you get at Dr offices where they make you wear their masks.  I plan to double up on these ( wear two of them). Not sure why close to 5 stars, these are average although they're black so maybe others feel they deserve they deserve 1.5 stars for that. I did notice the typical Chinese seller ""you've won a prize"" card which pretty much exchanges money or gifts for a good review so maybe that's why."
59,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Dec-20,AppleT,3,One,"I wear these everyday doing industrial maintenance so I thought black masks would be better than the blue/white ones. Clearly these are not all made equally. They really cheaped out with these. They are thin in every way. The nose piece, the straps, the material. So thin in fact they pucker at the cheeks and don’t hold their shape. With such a thin nose piece you look in the mirror and see 60 percent of the mask is on one side of your face. Going back to the other other masks."
60,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,16-Feb-21,Brian,1,2,"I need to wear one for work everyday.. These masks are cheap in quality. The bands that go around your ear rip very easily. The mask itself begins to fall apart, making the mask itchy and eventually not practical for use. Look elsewhere for reusable masks, this is a poorly made product."
61,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Jan-21,Jennifer C. Metzger,4,One,We tested this the same as the multi colored box (yellow green blue pink purple). When trying to blow out a lighter more Air comes through the black mask than the yellow so the flame flickers. The water doesn't drop through when filled but after the water is dumped you can almost completely blow the flame out through the wet black mask but not at all through the wet yellow mask. When we cut the black mask in half it had less layers and of a paper consistency vs the color mask which had more of the polypropylene layer so I'd purchase the colorful box again but not the black. only because this black mask seemed better than the other black masks on the Amazon market but if I can feel most air blow through it I don't believe the black mask is as effective as we would prefer.

You can no longer trust reviews online. Period. Everyone seems to have an angle. If you purchase these masks, you will be disappointed, in every way imaginable. Sad."
63,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Feb-21,Dria,5,,"Fits my big head. These disposable masks are large enough to fit my big head comfortably. I'm a woman with a big head, and ears. I normally buy size XL cloth face masks with the nose wire. I bought these for an emergency road trip to a State without a mask mandate and an uncontrollable high number of covid cases. A couple of the ear loops were too loose on one side, but you can double loop it around your ear. They're not tight on my ears, and they are as breathable as a surgical style mask can be. My glasses still fog a little, but they fog with all masks, even with the bendable nose wire. I wore these under a cloth mask, which is do-able. The key is to adjust both masks, and don't take them off until you're back in your home. I usually lower my mask when I get in my car, but lowering 2 masks is a pain because, they slid off my ears, and I had to readjust both of them again. If the masks tangle when taking them out of the plastic bag, flip the bag over and remove them from the other side. These masks served their purpose and I would recommend them."
64,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,24-Jan-21,K. Anwar,5,,"I was previously using a ""reusable"" fabric mask, and the standard face masks that doctor's offices provide. Once those ran out, I picked up this 50-pk of black masks, and I'm not sure what is different but these are MUCH more comfortable. They fit my face completely and extend from the middle of the nose bridge down below the chin. My girlfriend liked them so much she picked up a pack for herself! 50 masks is more than enough to keep a dozen or two in my car, and the rest in my house. With social distancing and in-trunk grocery pickup, I don't use very many masks as it is, so I am very happy with this product and will buy again once my current supply runs out in a few months."
65,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,9-Apr-21,Erika,4,,"I have seen people wear the black-colored mask and thought it looked pretty stylish and cool. I agree, I think for looks, it is a good mask. I cannot speak for how effective or protective the mask is because it is light-weight and thin. But it works for me. Another thing I would mention that I do not think it is gentle on the skin. When I first wore it, it made my face and nose very itchy. The second time it was okay, perhaps my skin got used to it. I am not sure what dye the company use, but for those with sensitive skin, I think you should avoid this mask. Also, it does not have a woven fabric inside the mask unlike others, so for comfort, I give it 3 out of 5."

No, they are NOT all one in the same.. I work in the restaurant/bar industry, we run hard constantly. We absolutly cannot rearrange masks, touch face to pull masks down after it starts creeping up, yadda yadda.. All the prior brands, most from Amazon, were typically really loose, or fuzzy/linty, or not breathable/very hot. I have a smaller face (female), while my coworker is a big dude and these masks were perfect! The elastic is tight enough to stay on me, but have give to be able to comfortably stay on a bigger face. The material is the best quality for these type masks I've felt and worn. Cooling, breathable, much better quality so they don't get little hairs and fuzziness when you sweat. Never shifts around! If I want an even more Secure fit, I twist the ear strap around once before pulling behind my ear for a little more snugness, and I still does not give any ear irritation. I cant be more happy to have clicked on these bad boys. It's about damn time, so much money thrown around trying to find great quality for disposable masks. I now have these literally have these on repeat order and the company is using these to supply the other stores now as well. Highly recommend for anyone, especially those specifically needing black, and industry workers!"
70,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,21-Jan-21,Tara,5,One,I have yet to find a reusable mask that doesn't fog up my glasses so I typically use these disposable ones. I like these black ones better than the blue. Don't know if it's physiological or reality but the black ones seem to be thicker and better made. I will definitely order from them again when I need a new supply. Now that we have competence in the WH hopefully we won't have to be ordering too many much longer though. :)
71,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Apr-21,Leowahine,1,,"The ad is misleading. The pictures clearly show a mask with 3 layers and a white “soft” material that would be against the face but it’s the same material as the outside! It’s rough, scratchy & itchy. I wonder if this is defective somehow. Maybe they forgot to cover the inside. Whatever the reason. They are definitely not like the pictures. I really don’t think it’s supposed to have the same material for the outside used on the inside. I’m returning them because I really think they’re defective since I don’t want to believe that Amazon would let a company mislead customers. These masks got a huge amount of reviews but I don’t believe it’s the same mask for all the reviews like maybe there’s a different color or something like that. Btw, it is lightweight but I think that’s because it doesn’t have that third layer that’s supposed to be against the face... The price is cheap but that’s not really a “good deal” if the product is actually missing a layer or layers. I didn’t bother to cut it apart once I saw and felt it was missing the white layer. I’m returning and will have to find a real “deal”. What a pain when the ads don’t tell the truth!"
72,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Feb-21,Sam,5,,"These work great! Stylish and fit well on an average sized adult head. They are of average breathability and did not cause irritation on my face. The package arrived completely sealed. They passed the flame test for us and if it doesn't for you, you might be wearing it wrong (remember to bend the wire down snugly over your nose and the bottom of the mask should go under your chin). We also tested them with water and they are water resistant. However if you're someone who still, after 11 months of pandemic, is wearing a mask with your nose hanging out... these masks won't help you. No one can help you. Just stay home."

I have worn them for a couple of hours at a time without issue. I bought these because my husband has a large full beard and has had a hard time finding a mask large enough to cover His face with the surrounding beard included. This mask was just right for him. The only downside for me has been that sometimes, even with the nose wire pinched to fit me, the mask has ridden up to poke the bottom of my eye. I do not have a small face. I would say I am a large or average sized person and have a face size to match and this mask was probably a little too big for me. I can breath easily while wearing it but I do not feel my breath come through the mask when I exhale. I would recommend this product."

If you want to double these, that is doable. I place them under my fabric custom masks for increased protection. I have a medium oval sized face & this mask construction allows for contouring feel on sides (I pressed inwards) & cinching over nose bridge & it’ll stay in place (if I’m not talking much- otherwise obviously it does move.) Ear loops aren’t cheap- they’re constructed nice to deal with & feel good, after hours. This mask doesn’t slip/gap a lot, because it’s made well & reacts to being pressed inward. Yes- I’ll buy these again!"
75,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Apr-21,Cyberlearn,5,,"I bought these to wear under a cloth mask during the double-masking phase, and they worked perfectly. I can breathe better with the paper under the cloth, and I don't feel like fibers are tickling my nose any more. The black goes with everything, and because I do a lot of yard work with moldy leaves and dust, I'm going to continue using these for gardening as well. The fit is comfortable, and you can pinch the wire around your nose for a uniform fit. The ear loops feel light and soft. I keep a small stack in the car because inevitably I forget to throw a mask in my purse. Very happy with this purchase!"
76,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,15-Jan-21,J,2,2,These are poorly made. The first one my husband pulled out of the pack snapped as he was pulling it out of the pack.

The only positive in my opinion are that they are light and comfortable. Conversely, they seem very thin and poorly fitted to my face which in my case allowed air in from various angles no matter what I did. Bottom line, I would not use them as replacement for multi layered cloth mask"

But if you want to know some details, i have added some. I gave it 4 out 5 stars for comfort because out of the box, they are very stiff.  they'll break in soon enough, then last at least twice as long as the common ""blue"" type. i gave it 4 out of 5 stars for stretch because they will fit a little large on most people.  this is easily remedied by twisting the elastic band on each side before putting it on your ears. Lastly, they look great.  i am very happy with them, recommend them and would buy them again."

The package came nicely packed and it doesn’t seem like any are defective as of yet. I wear one everyday to my job and to my university. Breathable. Light weight, but I still feel protected. I will continue buying from the seller, hopefully they keep on making them just like this."

Except they are black, inside AND out! They feed my dark soul. Actually I just loved that I didn’t have to see my makeup come off all over them and they always match my outfit. My husband loves them as he works a labor intensive job and the blue ones were always showing sweat marks and dirt. I’ve actually washed a few on accident and they’ve held up and we’ve re-used them! You can’t do that too much as they get fuzzy after a bit. But I definitely wear them more than once to get the most out of them."

They are super Duper thin and certainly offer very little protection from viruses. Two stars because I like the black color and they seem well-made for what they are. I have an average size women’s face and they were extremely loose on me without the ability to adjust. I tied knots in the elastic and that helped a bit. The metal nose piece is one of the better that I have tried but there is still air coming in on both sides of my face and below my chin. Also, they claim to have three layers but, if indeed they do, these layers are so incredibly thin that they appear to be a single layer. I could blow out a candle with this mask on.  I am returning these and suggest that you look further if you are looking for Covid protection."

These not only fit well but they hold up to putting them on and taking them off multitudes of times while others break the straps sometimes the first time you put them on. That's a total waste of money but these have turned out to be a great value! As a family we've been through a few hundred now and had no problems whatsoever so we'll be sticking with these going forward!

This is so bad, I have to place a piece of cotton material (Tshirt homemade mask) against my skin. Of course that adder layer makes breathing quite difficult for me. The material must be poorly made. I drink a large amount of water so amd constantly pulling my mask up or down to do so."

As you can see in the second photo, THERE IS NO 3-WAY FILTER. The mask is VERY THIN. When I wear the mask, there is a noticeable gap on both sides between the mask and my face. The point of a mask is to ensure the air only travels through the filter, not through any gaps. A mask is only effective when it fits, with no gaps, on your face."
86,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,27-Feb-21,Marty,2,,"I finally got around to trying these masks this morning, and although the mask itself appears to be made quite well, the ear loops are overly generous, which causes the mask to fit very loosely.  This might be okay for preventing others from catching your germs, but it doesn't provide very good protection for you yourself.  I have a pretty large head, and usually I have the opposite issue with masks being too tight. Overall, if the ear loops weren't so loose/big, I'd rate these masks at least a 4, but as-is, they're only getting 2 stars."

I used these in blue & white in the very beginning of the pandemic and decided to go back to them. I workout 4-5 days a week and wear mine during my workouts as well as wear it anytime I’m out in public and they are very comfortable & durable.

I used one each day while at Disney and it was more comfortable than my wife’s cloth masks (based on the fact that she needed mask breaks and I didn’t). These blocked out more smells than her cloth masks did for whatever that’s worth. My only complaint is they have a tendency to ride up - the top of the mask will ride up until it is resting against my lower eye lids and requires frequent adjustments. This isn’t ever mask and isn’t all day, but is a “sometimes” problem.  This may be because I have a very large head as my wife doesn’t have this issue. Overall very happy with these and they’ve become our go-to masks. They feel much better than traditional disposable masks and look better too."

I don’t recommend something that is not consistently okay. You lost a customer. This mask is the best light weight mask I’ve ever had! I can workout with it on and don’t feel like there much there! I feel more protection for some odd reason maybe because it conforms to my face better than any other mask I’ve ever seen. Really great value for your money, and it’s comfortable.

Obviously there are many tiers of masks based on comfort, durability, longevity, etc. While these are comfortable, they barely last an hour or two because the bands perpetually break; not something you want occurring during an outbreak. It’s irritating if you’re putting a mask on or off (without much pressure), and the band pops. Not only that, but the label on the box actually cautions against the use of the masks if they are damaged; so what’s the use of these things if I can’t use them to begin with?! 😡"
97,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,8-Mar-21,Andrew,2,,"The mask is uncomfortable to wear. Both sides of the mask have the same water resistant black outer layer, which makes it prone to fraying on the inside after little use. I have purchased other black masks which have a white cotton-like inner layer which does not fray—they are so much more comfortable than these masks as the frayed black fibers rub against your face and give you a constant itch. Further, the ear loops are no more comfortable than your standard white loops since they are not loose enough for people with larger heads. I do not recommend these masks"
98,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,18-Feb-21,Dalena,4,,"Pros: - The black color is definitely much more fashionable than the typical pale blue. - Material of the mask is sturdy and won't clog your nostrils if you try to inhale through your nose. This is a HUGE plus for me as I've regretfully become a mouth-breather due to masks being sucked into my vacuum nostrils. It's great to wear while running our working out. Cons: - Mask is too large for me that I had to tie a knot on each side of the ear loops. Granted, I am a 5'2, 110lb girl, but I have not had to tie knots on any other surgical masks that I've used in the past. - I wear glasses and this mask requires more adjustments to prevent my glasses from sliding than my current blue masks. It's possible, but you will have to play with the masks for a bit. Would I recommend it? Definitely!... if you have an average sized face and don't wear glasses. Otherwise, these are acceptable at most. I will try a new brand once I deplete this box."

He can breathe easily and he forgets he even has it on. Other disposable masks I've bought had tiny little fibers that would tickle our noses. It would drive us nuts. These do not have that.

After that they would break down a little and I felt like there was a string on my nose that would bug me. So excellent for 1 time use. They look good and r great to breath through. Not as good if u want them to last 3 or more wear times.

THE PROBLEM WITH THESE is that the ear straps are not secured to the face covering NEARLY well enough! I've thrown away 4 or 5 of these before I had gotten full use from them because one of the ends of the ear loops came loose from the covering.

Otherwise, yes they look great with everything. They feel pretty large on my face, but I adapted them to my taste. For smaller heads like mine, I recommend tying off knots with the ear loops or to buy the around the head mask holder/adjusters. With the tied loops, my ears were pushed forward which caused some discomfort after long periods of time. So yeah make the jump into the extender/adjusters for mask and you'll be good.

He said he had that problem when he would ride his bike home. During P.E. he would try to keep his mouth shut when doing activities so those times wasn't a problem for him.

I wasn't expecting luxury and it checked most boxes, but the biggest downside are the small strings that come away from the inside and outside of the mask.  The fiber it's woven with pulls away every single time outside making you look scary and more importantly inside where you breathe them in and they are always in your mouth.

Also I cannot confirm whether the masks are 3 ply but they are extremely thin and appear to be made from plastic rather than paper.  Every time I moved my head or jaw, the mask slipped off my nose or mouth.  Absolutely useless and I am donating them to charity with the caveat that they are not made for adults."

These masks were a great option, since you can wear black with anything, and the straps go behind your ear and don't pull on them too much. Fair warning though, these are somewhat loose-fitting so if you're looking to have a mask completely flush against your cheeks then I would consider another pair, but for a quick run into the store or something these work out perfectly!"

Unlike other surgical masks the inner layer material helps obsorb fluids, while the other is a material that helps repell. I put the mask on right after I opened it and had a weird smell, and probably not uncommon but I would open the box and let them sit there for a bit. For the price, it's a good mask. Not a magic mask, nothing special other than it being black. It gets the job done."

It might work to wear over another mask but I haven't had the opportunity to try that. That still wouldn't ease my mind about breathing in whatever that odor is from.

The process used to attach the string to the mask leaves the back side of the mask (where the mask contacts the face) abrasive like sand paper. I won't be able to wear these for long periods of time. Oh, and the package says 50 are included, but my package only had 49. If it were not for the abrasive effect of these, I'd keep them. I do not recommend these masks."

Unfortunately, I am a Bounty girl.  Also, I do not own a  RV or boat. Needless to say, I was disappointed.  This wasn't even a bait-and-switch, it was just plain dishonest.

I workout in them, and they usually stay over my nose pretty easily, and I can still breathe. I love that they're black so the mask will go with about any outfit. I would totally buy another pack.

However, the previous brand only came in blue, and I really did want black. I took the plunge, and it turns out that these masks are much better than the previous brand! They do a really good job fitting to the contours of my face and creating a nice ""cup"" around my nose and mouth. I have a thick beard, so I've always gotten leakage on the sides in the past, yet this brand seems to hug the sides a little tighter, creating more of a seal. Definitely buying more when needed."

The material was perfect, they’re disposable but they really were manufactured with care and health in mind. Upon my second order i automatically noticed the difference. The nose wire was no longer metal, it was flimsy, ear strings were extremely delicate, and the mask felt like a sheet of paper. I would not wear these masks in public like I used to. They just were no longer the quality I had been introduced to upon my first order. I submitted a refund for a return less order."

The part where the ear loops attach to the mask are very weak, and I guarantee they will break. This has happened to every single one so far. Could last a day, could last a week but it will happen. Worst part is that in most places where you're wearing a mask you obviously NEED to be wearing a mask, so I gotta always carry an extra one or two in case the current one breaks."

Also if the mask was able to be worn on either side (meaning no incorrect way) then they would've advertised it big time as major selling point.

I have coughed and blown black lint of my mouth and nose.

Smooth comfortable texture without that white backing like they have on the blue masks that sometimes tickle my nose with their fibers.  The nose strip works well to stay conformed around the top of your nose.  Elastic stretch band seems more comfortable and pull less on the ears as well.  I will buy these again.

One big plus is that they are bigger and fit my son who is 6'2 and my hubby who is 6'4. They don't have as big a problem with fogging your glasses either because of the snug nose bending nose piece.

As you can see in the photo, it is similar to a kitchen bag tie....it is white and plastice and not sewn into the mask.  Just laying under a flap that is open, thus the tie falls out as soon as you put the mask on.  Also, the description under 'Method of Use' on the box says the white side of mask should face in.  Both sides are black.  This is either a bad batch or they have made changes that hinder the proper use of this mask."

The discomfort comes from all the tiny fibers that come lose thorough the wear. Very itchy and tickles while being impossible to stop. For context I wear any given mask for roughly 10 hrs at work per day. These start to break down around the 5 hr mark. These would be fine for a quick trip to the store or to keep in a vehicle but not something you would want to wear for extended periods of time."

However,  the reason I did not give 5-stars is I can feel the air coming into the sides/perimeter of the mask every time I breath in, meaning there is not a very good “seal” or conformity to the face. Maybe this is not a big deal but it makes me feel like I’m not getting the protection I need."

The lack of an “inner fabric” type layer - that the inner and outer facing layers are both the same black material - makes it feel not as well made or protective, and makes it confusing to which side should be inward or outward. Otherwise, the mask is sturdy, comfortable, lightweight, and I and have no real issues. I do double-mask. For the price and my trust that it is 3-layered as advertised, the product is good."

I get free masks from the hospital but some of them hurt the back of my ears since the straps are too tight. These ones are very comfortable. The black ones look super cool too and fit my black scrubs lol. Only minor con I would say is the “fuzzies” you get inside after you wear them for awhile. But that’s expected with every mask.

This gray layer is actually an inner layer of the mask that you do not see unless you cut the mask open. If you take the mask off without pinching the nose clip, you have no idea which side was facing out or against your skin."
979,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,2-Feb-21,Andrew,1,,These are by far the worst masks I have ever purchased. There is no lining inside for any protection. They are extremely thin. There is not an inch of protection. I didn't purchase the masks for style. I purchased them to get some form of protection. I feel like I have to wear 5 of them to protect myself. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL END UP RETURNING THEM JUST AS I AM ABOUT TO. This should be a crime!
980,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Apr-21,JRV,2,,We bought these and was very dissapointed in them.

983,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,19-Dec-20,Phantom,1,,"Massive issue for this product is that for one it is the same color on both sides, if you were to re-wear this product you run the chance of putting on the ""infected"" side first. Second issue, is that it may be easy to breath with these but the layered protection isn't there. It is like putting a piece of mesh on your face. Sure it does give you coverage, but not really protection. Masks are also very cheaply made."
984,disposable_mask,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQZYSWK,10-Jan-21,Sean Doherty,5,,"Unlike other masks, these masks do not itch one's nose and they have plenty of space to breathe. On top of that, the strings stay attached, unlike others. We are staying with this brand for sure!"
