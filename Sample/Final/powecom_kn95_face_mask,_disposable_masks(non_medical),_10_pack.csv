8-Aug-20,S,1,3270,1,Full manufacturer name is Guangzhou Powecom Labor... This GB2626 mask is on the CDC ist of masks that does not meet  standards.
3-Aug-20,Rob F,5,1158,0,"1) The Anit-Counterfeit label was vetted via the Guanzhou Powercom Chinese website, and was found to be authentic.  I have developed products with anti-Counterfeit labels, and this label looked authentic and was similar to others I have used in the past.  I made up a dozen random numbers and none came up as authentic except for the one on the package label. 2) I also cut one of the 10 masks up, and it is in fact constructed they way they describe with the right number of layers, the right number and type of melting attachment points, and the right type of fabric / material at each layer. 3) And it is on the FDA list, and is not on the FDA removed list. So for the above 3 reasons, I have high confidence that this is an authentic KN95 Respirator.  (I'm no professional...)"
30-Jul-20,Don Germann,4,501,0,"Just received the product; major concern was the absence of the Qualification Certification (providing the production date and FDA approval) that was advertised to be included in the bag.  However using the FDA website I was able to validate that the product is included on the latest FDA Emergency Use Authorization List as advertised.  The anti-fake validation procedure appears to work; it identified  the number on bag as valid and also reminded me I had already checked this number before (I did.)  Also attempted to spook the system by entering an invalid number and it reported a fake.  Only problem is the ear loops are a bit tight, but, I believe, workable. Don G"
28-Aug-20,Kevin Riggle,5,433,0,"Since California is on fire once again, and earlier in the year than I think any of us expected, I hastily went looking for N95 masks for my house to replace the ones we all donated to local hospitals back in March.  After far too long wading through too many questionable Amazon sellers and the CDC's emergency use authorization list, I settled on these. Pros: - A reputable Chinese manufacturer (Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies) - On the CDC emergency use authorization list (*) - Being sold by the same seller the listing mentions (Innovate Tech) - Not sold out or earmarked for medical and first responders - Reasonably priced (~$3/mask) (*): From the looks of it, the CDC tested 5 Powecom samples, four of which filtered >95% of particles and one of which filtered 93-94% of particles, which is why it's on both the ""good"" list (four times) and the ""bad"" list (once).  This is confusing on the CDC's part, but I believe it's what is happening.  While these results suggests some potential quality control issues on Powecom's side or counterfeiting issues on the importing and distribution side (e.g. Amazon), and I wouldn't buy these masks as a hospital stockroom administrator unless I was out of better options, for wildfire smoke as a private citizen, the choice between a mask that doesn't quite filter 95% of particles and no filtration at all is an easy one. Cons: - A KN95 mask, not an N95 mask (**) - An earloop design rather than a headband design (but see **) ** Apparently the big difference between the Chinese KN95 standard and the US N95 standard *is* that earloop designs are allowed under the former but not under the latter.  The article I read on the difference said it's because the US believes it's harder to achieve an appropriately airtight fit with the earloop designs.  I've struggled with mask fitting my face in the past, and especially with masks fogging up my glasses, so I was worried about this. The masks arrived today and tl;dr I'm very happy with them.  They arrived from Innovate Tech, sealed in the official packaging as depicted, and the Anti-Fake Label verified correctly on Powecom's site.  The masks themselves feel good---the nose piece is solid but easy to shape, the material is soft and thick without being heavy, and pinching and pulling at the masks makes it obvious there are three layers of material (front and back shell layers and the filter layer). As mentioned by other reviewers, the ""holes"" in the mask where light shines through are solid. They're not actually air holes the places where the mask material has been sintered together---a quick fit test demonstrated that the masks can achieve an airtight fit. I'm pleasantly surprised by how well the earloop design fits me.  The test for a KN95 or N95 mask is if you can achieve an airtight fit with it, and the way you check is by putting it on and then inhaling quickly.  If you feel the mask press against your face when you do, and you don't feel or hear air escaping out the sides, then you've got a good fit and will get the full protection of the mask.  Despite the earloop design and a day's growth of stubble, I still got an airtight seal with these masks. I would absolutely buy these again, highly recommended if you're in California or another state dealing with fires and smoke right now."
22-Jul-20,Gale P.,2,357,0,"Even though these masks seem well made, they are too small and tight.  I found it very difficult to breathe while wearing it because there is no room in the mask and it’s kind of smashed against your face.  My husband couldn’t even put one on because it was so small.  I would not recommend."
4-Aug-20,Gerard Muller,5,317,0,"In March I started wearing a 3MN95 mask I had on hand until the rubber band broke. With the unavailability of N95 masks I then went to KN95 masks. Of the three KN95 mask suppliers I've used, this mask appear to be best because while the elastic ear loops are tight they assure that the mask seals well which is the objective here, after all. The tight seal is made more bearable by virtue of the soft material used at the edges. When testing the edge leakiness by breathing hard in and out I didn't notice any leakage. As for the filter efficiency I'll have to depend on the FDA testing for that. Overall, the best of the masks I've used, including the 3MN95 which is too restrictive for long, active use."
21-Aug-20,John W. Carney,1,211,1,Shortly before delivery we received an email from the manufacture of the masks indicating the delivered masks might be “fake.”  The email stated a verification code could be found by scraping the coating from a label on the packaging that would reveal numbers that could be entered on the manufacturer's site to check authenticity. Unfortunately the numbers revealed on our packaging were extremely small and worse were partially removed by the scraping.  While the attempt to help was commendable it’s execution was not. If you buy these masks scrape carefully and have a magnifying class at hand.
30-Jul-20,Marvin,4,152,1,"Top heading says efficiency is 99.2% but package has no such statement.  Package just says >95%, which typically just means ""slightly"" over 95%.  Other than that issue masks seem ok but there is no way to test this.  I bought this product since the advertisement seemed to indicate that it was better filtering than the basic 95% masks. I consider this advertising just a bit misleading."
21-Jul-20,Toni,5,115,0,I had bad experiences with different masks before and I was curious if I will really like this mask. It was easy use and easy to breath with this mask. Finally I found what I am looking for. I will buy again.
3-Sep-20,LBP,5,77,0,"Good Lord, are some people just insane? No, these were not made in 2006. No, they are not undersized. No, they are not uncomfortable. No, they do not have dirt and hair on the inside or outside. No, they are not fake or unapproved. I can only conclude, as often seems to be the case, that there is a hidden agenda underlying the 1-star reviews. I am a 6'-1"" man. The masks fit perfectly well and are perfectly comfortable on both me and my wife. They are the same size as every other mask I have, and I own four brands. They are thicker and seem to be higher-quality than the other Chinese masks I have, which cost so much they were still overpriced after the seller had refunded half the purchase price. I bought 20 of these for less than I had paid for 6 of the other Chinese masks. I see absolutely no downside to these, and I have no hidden agenda or dog in the mask wars."
9-Sep-20,Kevin Boulder,3,58,0,"In light of the difficulty finding U.S. certified N95 masks, the best we can usually find these days are certified as KN95. These are made in China and are not quite as good as N95. As of the date I am writing this review, they claim a 99.2% filter efficiency. This mask was reviewed by the CDC using the NIOSH standard for testing and it pulled just below 95% filter efficiency. This is still much, much better than a homemade cloth mask so if you will be in a situation where you would prefer to have greater protection, these should provide a bit more confidence. You can see in the photo that they ship folded flat. There is a bendable strip in the nose piece area that you can conform to the shape of your own nose. They are secured to your face via loops around the ears. This is not as good as a proper N95 mask that would have elastic bands around the back of your head but it should fit well enough. The loops themselves are not elastic rubber but instead that semi-elastic, stretchy woven cloth. Some might find that more comfortable but it will be at the expense of a tighter fit to your face and therefore, slightly higher chance of exposure."
22-Aug-20,Yves K,5,62,1,"The attached images show 100x magnifications of the filtration layer of a POWECOM KN95 mask that I disassembled (along with an out of focus human hair for size comparison) as well as a filtration layer of a KN95 mask that is not FDA authorized (no hair).  In both, the fibers are much narrower than a human hair. However, the filtration layer in the POWECOM mask looks a lot denser than the other, which appears to have small gaps. One thing to note is that this mask can run a bit tighter than some others. We all have differently sized heads, and when it comes to respirators, there is something called a fit test, and you want a mask that fits you well so that 1) all air passes through - not around - your mask, and 2) wearing the mask does not cause you pain."
27-Aug-20,David,1,66,0,"They are comfortable and easy to breathe in but that is due to the fact they are super thin. My daughter, who is a an ER nurse, put one of these on and could tell right away it does not filter at the level of an N95. An N95 is very restrictive to breath in. This mask will work as a surgical type mask but it is deceptive to market these as comparable to U.S. N95."
22-Aug-20,C. Davis,1,71,1,"Paper thin, doubt these are 5 layer.  scary if these are fda approved. I have non fda approved kn95s that are twice as thick. not individually packed. bought them for $40 then they cut the price in half the next week.  Would not buy again, way overpriced for low quality product"
11-Sep-20,Toni M. Whited,1,45,1,"A KN95 mass should be waterproof, have five layers, and be flame proof. So we did a test, thus sacrificing a mask. This one drips, it has four layers, and catches on fire. It also weighs more than one gram less that our other KN95s, which do pass said tests. Nuff said. No good.  Never buying these again."
4-Sep-20,JBonAmazon,1,45,1,"I bought some real KN95 masks at Lowe's, so I know that these aren't real ones. The masks are significantly smaller, like for a small face, and they are not as thick in lining, and the elastic is shorter.  In addition, the ""KN95"" is not actually embossed into the mask, like it is on the Lowe's masks.  However, thanks to Amazon's great return policy, I was able to get my money back.  This is why I always shop at Amazon."
25-Jan-21,TarablyTara,5,32,0,"Make sure you are buying from Innovate Tech. DO NOT purchase the one sold by Amazon, instead go to “other sellers” in the box and look for sold by Innovate Tech, otherwise you will get a fake product. There is a QR code to scan and verify. I bought both (one sold by Innovate and one by Amazon) Innovate’s product was genuine but not Amazon’s. Just because it says from Amazon it is still really a third party seller. They have made a really good fake but the QR code does not check out. I am returning the fake one!"
20-Oct-20,nick,1,35,1,Very likely fraudulent. The masks come in a bag that is 'sealed' with adhesive that allows someone to alter the contents of the bag. Additionally the manufacturer website authentication tool revealed that the verification code had already been used. Twice. The QR code on the authorization sticker opens an app store page for a chat app... I would not trust this product to be what it claims.
26-Jan-21,dawtravelbug,1,27,1,"Buyer beware. The masks I received were in Powecom packaging but the masks inside were not Powecom's.  They were fakes.  Powecom masks have specific designations stamped on the mask. This proves authenticity, and classification certification.  Important: According to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) you should NOT buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it. Only KN95 with these designations stamped on the mask, have proven to filter almost as well as N95. If you get a mask with nothing stamped on the mask, return it, it's a fake."
4-Sep-20,Amazon Pete,1,33,1,They say they are on the FDA approved list for a respirator. I have seen the mask sold other reputable dealers and they say it is not FDA approved. They have the same stamp same bag and same little piece of paper in them. They are 4 cheap layers. Also these are advertised as adult masks but they are children’s mask. I would not recommend these masks.
4-Oct-20,DP,3,28,1,"One of the ways to determine whether a KN-95 is legit is the water test. Open the mask a little bit, pour a few tablespoons of water inside, and see if it leaks. Well, it did, immediately - in 3 different places (circled in photo)! I would not want to be wearing this mask in a high-risk environment. Disappointed. While I find the mask comfortable and am sure that it provides better protection than a piece of cloth, I was hoping for better from an FDA EUA manufacturer."
22-Aug-20,fredrick peters,2,31,0,"Upon opening the package, several of the masks were dirty with a black makeup-like substance. Also, when I tried one of the masks on, the material instantly ripped at the attachment site. The company has since offered a full refund."
25-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,1,24,1,"Something seems fishy with my most recent purchase of these masks. I ordered a pack of these (ear loop style) several weeks ago (first photo) and just ordered a pack of the same ones for my mother (second photo). When they arrived she said the packaging said headband style, which was not what we ordered (3rd photo). Then she opened them and they were in fact ear loop style (which is odd). She sent me a photo of the anti-fake code and when I checked it on the site, the numbers said it was a real mask, but the image (colors and patterns) of the bars and boxes for the bar code were completely different. When I checked my own packages of masks the patterns matched exactly what was shown online. When she sent a photo of the mask it looked different than mine in several ways (the welding spots all had different patterns, while mine looks exactly like the photos on Amazon and the Powecom website). Hers also had “KN95” imprinted (not just with ink) on the mask much like I’d seen with many other brands of KN95 masks (again, mine did not have this). I can’t actually touch these masks to see if they feel legit as she lives in another state but all of this has me doubting their authenticity. It is too bad but if feel like someone is trying to pass off another mask as Powecom since they are on the FDA approved list. I also just tried to email the people listed on the Powecom website and all emails were unable to be delivered."
26-Oct-20,shinobi,1,22,1,"I was sent a package of the masks on the left. The masks on the right are originals, made for China (not for export). The masks I was sent though Amazon are clearly of inferior quality, they are thinner and rougher feeling, the seams are incorrect and not triple stamped around the edges, and the ear loops are stamped on differently. I’m returning and hoping for the best from another seller."
10-Aug-20,iScubaD,5,20,0,"This KN95 mask is bit pricey.  The mask quality seems OK for 4 layer as verified on Powecom website.  The fit was OK since you need to make adjustment for proper fit.  Check for anti-fake authenticity label on bag to scratch off silver covering for numbers to check on Powecom website to see that you are the first to query it.  First, I checked my date and time.  I entered number first time on Powecom website as I was able to see it authenticated.  When I entered the number for second time, it does say it was queried twice with date and time when I first queried.  As of 8/10/2020 FDA's Appendix A listed this mask as authorized imported, Non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China.  There were other quality checks for its authenticity of KN95 masks based on research from various websites.  As of 8/10/2020, so far this mask seems OK.  Things may change overall so be sure to check your own research to verify it all."
29-Aug-20,Thomas Birkemeier,4,19,0,"These would be 5 stars except for the fact that they run small. Other than that, I don't have covid yet so I guess they're doing their job. They have a good seal, seem to be decently made, and the ear elastic hasn't popped yet like so many others do after one use. On a side note, these don't have holes in them. People who say that aren't observant enough to even notice that the clear spots aren't holes, but it's where the layers are melted together using high frequency welding. This takes the place of stitching (which opens up holes) and adhesives (which aren't good to breathe). The melted material is clear, which gives some people the indication that there's holes (which there isn't)."
10-Nov-20,ROZ,1,16,0,This comes in a resealable bag. So anyone could open and close it from the manufacturer to the warehouse to the customer. How can anyone know if this has not been tampered with? If the authenticity sticker is supposed to identify this it was placed right below the seal. See picture. This is unlike other stickers that break off so you know it was opened. The other issue is the powecom website will not load to check the authenticity. Tried 3 times so who knows if this is real.
10-Sep-20,Stephen Cataldo,5,15,0,"It's a little lighter than the 3M disposables: a great compromise for both smoke and COVID. The 5-stars-arent-enough 3M masks, my disposable single-use masks that have lasted 6 months, are hard to breathe through when biking or walking hard when the out-vents are blocked so that I don't spread COVID. These seem almost as good as those heavier masks for smoke, and comfortable enough to wear for social distance walks. Seems ok so far for rotating and wearing over and over, no broken bands yet. If they make me stand in a line to vote, surrounded by COVID and a burning planet, I would wear one of these."
11-Oct-20,Grokyourself,1,17,1,These are not any 95. They failed home testing. Probably counterfeit. Not for virus protection
12-Sep-20,Vick1L,5,14,0,"These maskes passed all three tests for effectiveness.  I did the water test, and it did not leak.  I did the blowing out of the candle test, and I could not blow out the flame. Lastly, I did the light test.  I held the mask up to the light, and the mask was a uniform thickness, not blotchy.  According to the CDC, if a mask passes these tests, then it is effective.  I also feel like there is a good seal around the edges of the mask.  It is more comfortable than an N95.  I can wear this mssk all day at work."
7-Oct-20,Katherine,3,13,1,"Subpar quality, poor fit. These are exactly what you’d think of when when “made in China”. The mask’s shape doesn’t allow a close secure fit to the face. No matter how I adjust the nose wire and ear bands tons of unfiltered air gets in through the sides. I’m an EMT and we test our masks with a “sniff test”. We spray a scented fragrance in the air with the mask on. If you can smell the fragrance, the mask has failed and isn’t working properly. These mask fail the sniff test no matter how I adjust them. They only pass the test if I use both hands to closely secure the mask to my face. It seems the filtering material of the mask itself works, however that’s useless if you can’t get a secure fit.  It’s better than cloth masks in a pandemic but they are in no way comparable to classic N-95’s."
14-Sep-20,Geocouple,3,15,0,"I scraped the tag to get the verification code.  Be sure to be careful because it is easy to scratch it off.  And checked on the Powecom.com website to see if it was valid, which it said it was.  But how do you know?  I cut up a piece of the mask material and there were indeed 5 layers.  Very thin layers.  See photo attached.  The fit is comfortable.  Maybe my overall rating of three stars is too tough, but I just don't know how to be sure."
25-Aug-20,CiCi Cimi,5,13,0,"Amazon still says these are expected to be here next week, but I got them yesterday, two days after ordered. The anti-fake code worked and, I didn’t initially realize, the company sent an email via amazon with instructions on how to do it. For people concerned these aren’t on a CDC list, that list is for NIOSH certified N95 masks, currently prioritized for health care. The FDA has a list, which this company claims to be on and are, for authorized emergency usage of KN95 or other country equivalents to N95s. They did not make false claims and I’m glad I was able to get them but know they are legit. I do work in healthcare and we don’t have enough supplies so I get what I can for myself when I can. If I need more and these are available I will go to them first because of the peace of mind of them being real and effective."
1-Feb-21,TDA,1,10,1,"I’ve been buying POWECOM FDA approved masks for months from another retailer, but for more money. I saw them here for cheaper and that they were bought and sold by amazon and thought I would try them out to see if they were real. Each package comes with a verification sticker on it, where you scratch like a lottery ticket and then enter the numbers into the official POWECOM verification site. When I did that, it showed that these were fakes, which I could tell from the sticker immediately! I had a bag left over from a previous verified purchase, as I mentioned above, and the difference was clear. The numbers on this bag were illegible and fabricated. The masks themselves also were of a lesser quality but looked the same as the originals, as did the bag. I contacted AMAZON and they reviewed and acknowledged that the batch I received were indeed fake. They are obviously still being sold but I was told they disposed of the fakes and restocked with a verified batch. Moral of the story...take the time to scratch the sticker (on the bottom of the bag) and input into powecom website. The numbers should be clear and not missing and powecom will let you know if they are safe to wear. Amazon refunded me, of course. I think I Would rather pay the extra to know what I'm getting is safe and effective. So wrong to scam people firing these times.  Also the real ones are indeed FDA approved, by EU standards. I researched these for awhile. Other than that, the real ones are fantastic and everyone should try them out!! They ensure safety and are comfy, with a snug fit! Hope those helps. Pay attention to what you put on your face!"
22-Jan-21,Cherie,5,13,0,"I was in a car with my someone, whom I did not know was COVID positive at the time, for 3 hours (family emergency).  I wore this mask and he wore a typical, thinner blue mask.  He had been exposed a few days before and tested positive a few days later.  All of my tests have been negative."
15-Oct-20,V and M,5,11,0,"My girlfriend and I found the masks to fit comfortably.  I don’t do well with masks that attach behind my ears, but these are a pleasant exception.  She’s a former RN with a couple years as a scrub nurse.  She assures me that these masks don’t have the fit to be hospital-grade.  While the mask has an appropriately placed wire, she’s still getting a bit of leakage around the upper part of the nose and perhaps the cheek.  But she still loves the mask as the vast majority of air flow comes through the mask.  The company and the mask are approved by the FDA.  I did an internet search on “fda kn95 approved list” and chose the site “Personal Protective Equipment DUAs| FDA”.  In the section “Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated: October 9, 2020)” I found  Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies Co., LTD  with a respirator model KN95.  There was an anti-fraud sticker on the package that I received.  As instructed I scraped of the outer layer of the sticker and typed the revealed number into an input field on Guangzhou’s website.  I got a verification.  I input the same number modified by one digit and got an error message."
20-Nov-20,Deborah,1,12,1,"What I received is not what is shown in listing photos or other purchaser photos ... No Powecom writing on the mask itself, and no authentication sticker.  Packaging itself appears to be the same. As these are now fulfilled directly through Amazon, I’m disappointed that I cannot trust these to be authentic based on the difference between the product as shown and what I received. Powecom website shows both a stamped mask and the authentication sticker on each bag.  What I received has neither, at best there is no way I can trust these to be authentic."
18-Aug-20,Nicholas Rasmuson,4,16,0,"Received these KN95 mask’s GB2626-2006 In the mail today. They were in plastic package as shown, masks that arrived were as shown in picture. They seem to be well-made. nose piece appear to be good in our inside the material, and elastic straps are correctly place and seem to be secure. Package did have tiny security label. I removed the scratch of the surface and went to the website and was able to input the security number and have them verified real. They are listed on the FDA.gov site in the Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated: August 14, 2020). I will use these under a cloth mask when traveling."
26-Jan-21,Freespirit625,1,11,0,"Terrible!  Not even in bag. Loose in the shipping bag with the paperwork like they were a return. Not sanitary at all!  Also very small with short ear loops, more for a child than adult."
27-Sep-20,John Estrada,1,10,1,"I opened my package hoping for a quality product somewhat close to the quality of the N95 masks I have had in the past but I was extremely disappointed. Not only were these masks super thin, in fact so thin you can see your finger run past many parts of the mask, but there are also holes in the mask that look like they go through. How can this stop anything? In addition, these masks are so small, it is meant for kids, not an adult. They could not seal around my mouth as even with the best of efforts to adjust the nose and ear loops, it just would not fit. For a minute, I thought I got scammed because this site was down for a week. I thought Amazon took them off their site which I applauded at the time. Now I must warn people not to waste their money with this product. Please do not waste your money on this product. I wouldn't trust my health wearing such a cheaply made low-quality product. No way, no how!"
30-Sep-20,Ralph,4,9,0,"UPDATE: To seal the masks to your nose area, use Silly Putty or the equivalent. Roll out a piece about 1/4"" thick and 3"" long and stick it to the inside of the mask  around the nose area. When you bend the metal strip around your nose, the plastic will deform and lightly stick to your skin producing a perfect seal. I've now found that if you put a couple of strips of plumbers teflon tape to cover the silly putty so the tape is next to your skin, it seals better and the silly putty doesn't stick to your face. ORIGINAL: The problem with these masks is that the metal strip at the top used to bend to fit your nose is too short and unlike the 3M mask there is no foam sealing strip at all. IMHO these design ""features"" are just dumb cost cutting, adding those features would cost pennies and would make the masks much easier to use. I did find it possible to get a good seal, but it was tricky."
22-Aug-20,Vee,1,17,0,Not worth it.
11-Sep-20,Lauren,4,8,0,"Good enough. Not sure if these KN95 masks are truly verified/authentic, but they are made well and I feel good about the protection they provide. They are a little big on my face, and the ear loops must be carefully stretched out first to be comfortable, but they form a good seal. They also make it comfortable to breathe, even though it is thick, layered material, probably because it sits away from the mouth and nose, unlike a surgical mask. My only main complaint is that they have an unpleasant, chemical smell right out of the package. I took all of mine out and hung them from hangars in my closet to let them air out, and they no longer smell. I also added a few drops of eucalyptus oil on the inside, which I recommend trying. The only other minor complaint I have is the nose piece could be a little bit more mailable, but it’s no big deal. —Bottom line, I feel a lot more secure out in public wearing these masks than I did with the surgical type masks. They are comfortable enough and reusable (put it in a paper bag after removal and rotate wearing them). They do seem overpriced, but they are still worth the money. I might try a different brand next time, but I am satisfied with these."
25-Nov-20,Jonny C,3,7,1,"*Masks on left were verified online through website, masks on right had no sticker to verify and have different markings and feel. *Performed the leak test on the masks on the right.  They failed miserably. Water droplets were leaking within seconds of filling masks with some water. Completely disappointed in this order. The previous orders the masks seemed authentic with a method to confirm on their company website. This most recent order did not come with the verification sticker and also looks and feels different from previous orders. I will be collecting a refund from an unopened package. Pay attention to the markings on previous orders and compare it to more recent orders from the current seller. There are slight differences with the overall feel and look of these masks. Buyer beware. Unfortunately, this is the risk we assume when buying online and sometimes through third party sellers."
28-Jan-21,Anthony,1,7,1,"These masks are great! However, I received two fake shipments from Amazon, even with the “Ships and Sold by Amazon.com”. The sent masks were extremely similar to the real ones, even passed the anti-fake code, except the colors on the website did not match the same colors on the text for the code. The masks also had “KN95” printed on both sides of the mask that wasn’t present on any of the pictures on Amazon. I purchased the same brand/type from Office Depot that matched the colors of the verification code AND did not have “KN95” printed on the mask itself. Amazon was able to refund me for the purchases, but without carefully looking at the masks, it would be hard to tell if they’re legitimate."
22-Jul-20,Amazon Customer,4,19,0,"Masks arrived early via USPS, package was intact. I like the fact that the powecom KN95 masks are FDA approved."
14-Aug-20,Qmonk,3,11,0,"Received 10 days earlier than the estimated delivery date from Amazon. These masks are ok, not bad but not great. Mask size is ""relatively"" small.  Guess they were made to fit Chinese faces. Compared to all other masks I have bought, these are OVERPRICED.  They may be worth $2 a piece the most."
13-Oct-20,Primrose Hill,2,5,0,"Just received my package of 10 Powecom KN95 ear-loop masks today. I mainly ordered these on behalf of an elderly relative who has to receive a 4-hour medical treatment (renal dialysis) on 3 days a week in a room full of other ill patients, and who is not always given a surgical paper mask to wear at the facility and sometimes has to rely on the self-provided mask that he wears during the transportation from his home to the facility to continue to protect him during the 4-hour treatment.  For those days when he has to fall back on the self-purchased mask that he wears from home, I wanted him to have the most-protective mask that we can obtain in a straightforward way as private consumers, and I found this listing after a lot of searching. I confirmed for myself that this mask is listed on the US government site regarding accepted masks (I momentarily forget which site it is -- FDA or CDC), just as they claim.  Most of the other ""KN95"" masks that seem to be available for retail purchase are not on that list. For myself, in situations where I need to wear a mask, I have lately been wearing blue surgical paper masks that I buy at a local Kroger, and before I found that brand, I had to go through quite an array of brands before I found one where the surgical paper masks did not have a bad odor and/or did not immediately irritate my facial skin.  Even with a silicone mask holder that I wear around the back of my head, the paper masks seal on my face only moderately well, and they cling to my mouth no matter how I arrange the paper folds, especially when I talk.  Therefore, if I could find a more-structured KN95 mask that is comfortable, well-made, and fits my face well, I would switch to that type of mask.  So I was curious to try these out for myself, as well as having my relative try them. I opened the package tonight.  The 10 masks are not individually sealed, but rather are stacked together and placed in a plastic pouch that is not fully air-sealed along all edges (like a potato chip bag would be, or something like that), but has a sticky seal on the open side of the pouch which is folded over to close the pouch (like a self-seal flap of a paper envelope). I pulled the top mask off of the pile and put it on for about 3 seconds.  I would have worn it longer tonight to see how well it would seal around my face and if it inadvertently poked into my eyes (like a lot of masks do, because they are one-size-fits-all and made to accomodate people with larger faces than mine), but I needed to take it off quickly because it had an unpleasant ""chemical"" odor. I can't imagine wearing the mask and breathing in that odor for 10 minutes, let alone for several hours straight. I must say that I am more sensitive to odors than most people, so most people might not be bothered by this chemical odor. Additionally, one of the other reviewers here wrote that her masks had an unpleasant odor to them, so she hung them on hangers in her closet and let them air out, and they did eventually lose the odor in her experience, so that is encouraging, and is definitely something that I would do if I had no choice but to use these masks. Unfortunately, after I took off the mask that I had worn for just a moment, the skin on and around my nose and upper cheeks began to feel irritated, sore, and ""chapped"" (like a winter wind burn on the cheeks).  Now, a whole hour after I took the mask off, my skin still feels that way.  I don't know if this irritation is due to a chemical that is in the material, or to the surface scratchiness of the material itself, or to both. Even if the masks didn't have an odor that is (at least at this point in time, before any airing-out) too unpleasant for me to breathe in, I don't think I could wear them because of the lasting skin irritation that my nose and cheeks are still feeling, after having only fleeting contact with the material. I will note that my skin has always been sensitive, and in the last 5 years I have occasionally experienced this kind of skin irritation from some fabrics/pieces of clothing that have been apparently treated with some anti-insect, anti-mold/mildew types of chemicals at the point of manufacture.  I've bought a couple of items of clothing that never lost that chemical coating (even after I washed them numerous times and used vinegar, baking soda, borax, etc. in the wash water) and which I've had to give away, because they gave me an instant, visible skin rash whenever I tried to wear them. All-told, my first impression is that I am disappointed in these masks, at least for me, due to their noticeable odor and the facial skin irritation that I experienced from having brief contact with the mask material.  For myself, I will be sticking with my paper ""surgical-type"" masks from Kroger which are the least uncomfortable, least smelly, least scratchy masks that I have been able to find this year. I will now give this initial pack of 10 of Powecom ear-loop masks to the relative whom I ordered them for, to see if he likes them more than the blue-fronted paper surgical masks for travelling to and from (and sometimes for during) his dialysis sessions.  He is much less sensitive to odors and chemicals than I am, so I hope that these masks will work for him."
29-Sep-20,Jane W,1,10,1,"unfortunately, these masks are on revall list for defective protection. Not useable for the 95% efficiency advertised."
1-Feb-21,Cynthia H.,1,8,1,"I ordered KN95 masks that were reportedly made by Powecom (which are on the FDA emergency authorization list). Multiple images of the masks on the Amazon page *clearly* show masks that are imprinted the company name and other identifying markings. However, the masks I *received* had NO identifying marks at all (see image), which should appear on genuine Powecom KN95 masks. They were labeled ONLY with the word KN95. Therefore, it appears that the masks are counterfeit and thus I was unable to use them."
20-Nov-20,fixxxer,1,6,1,"The FDA site has about 5 reports (some as recent as October 2020) with photos showing the masks that were approved and tested. MY mask does not match any of these.  I can only assume it is counterfeit.  At a minimum, it does not have FDA EUA approval as the description indicates. All the FDA website masks have 2 solid line/bars on the left and right ""cheeks"" that hold the layers together.  Mine has about 11 dashed dimples that you can see through.  Clearly a different mask.  Packaging and writing on the mask also varies."
4-Nov-20,adam colbert,1,7,1,"I purchased a 10 pack to test them out. I wore one out and about and it was reasonably comfortable. I decided to do further research to see if these were actually KN95 masks as claimed. I've uploaded 3 photos showing my findings. I cut into the mask revealing that the mask only has 3 layers. I'm sure it will offer some protection, but these are not legitimate KN95 masks. The mask I tested was actually water proof and did not drip. The masks did melt when burned, so I guess that's a plus. I won't be using these going forward. It appears that these are not actually built to the correct standard for KN95 masks. I realize this company shows photos of certification, but it's likely the quality has gone down, or real KN95s were submitted to the agency that was doing the certification."
28-Aug-20,Sweetlytam,5,7,0,"It is so hard to navigate through real and fake products, I decided on these because they have the FDA Eua, even then I was a little skeptical as I am high risk and so are several in my family one being my pregnant daughter with lupus. I was pleasantly surprised when the seller reached out and sent me information to verify authenticity with numbers on each bag, it mean a lot that they wanted to make sure I felt safe while using their product."
3-Sep-20,Graphic Fusion,5,6,0,"What I like most about this mask is the anti-fake label, which works as intended.  When I checked my masks on the manufacturer website, they all came up genuine.  When I checked one package twice, the website told me someone had already checked that number at the date and time of my first check - and that it might be counterfeit.  So their ""anti-fake"" system does work. Kudos to the seller for emailing me prior to receipt of my shipment to tell me how to check the authenticity of the masks! There appears to be no size or form standard for a KN95 mask.  This mask seems to be of very ""average"" size and shape.  It fits like any other KN95 mask - fussy around the nose, and irritating to the ears.  It fits better if you snip the elastic ear loops and tie them onto headbands.  An ""ear saver"" does almost as well, but it can make the cheek area bag and leak.  The mask cannot function to its true potential unless it is tightly sealed.  I suppose that's possible with tape over the bridge of the nose."
13-Nov-20,Sandra Festian,2,6,1,"These were such a disappointment.  I have purchased many KN95 masks over the past few months which I modify when needed for a better seal using thin weather stripping (sticky on one side) which I attach along the inner edge against the face.  The quality of KN95 masks varies wildly.  I had high hopes for these but in my opinion these are among the worst I have seen.  They LOOK good but don't function well. Next to the effiency of the filtering layer as a protective barrier, the seal of a mask is as vital .  If the seal is faulty air seeks the path of least resistance and pours in.  I was unable to get these to form an adequate seal regardless of how many layers of foam I used or how I shaped the stiff nose piece.  I even removed the plastic strip serving as a nose wire and added a better quality wire.  It appears that the fabric used for the outer layer of this mask is inferior to other masks I have purchased.  The material in these masks is not pliable enough to form and hold a curvature along the edge against the face. Be careful.  Beware.  They look good but without a better fit don't depend on these for protection for contagion."
27-Jan-21,hayley gallagher,1,8,1,"We’ve ordered several times from this posting. This last time we received counterfeit masks. Look at the picture. On the right are the genuine masks with the anti counterfeit label at the bottom and the left is the most recent order. Upon checking the powecom website, these are counterfeit. Make sure to check for the genuine label on the bottom before you use!"
24-Aug-20,Leslie,1,12,0,These are very small and my ears were in pain almost immediately. Won't be wearing any in the rest of the pack. Maybe ok for a child's face?
15-Sep-20,Js,4,7,0,"The COVID-19 virus is currently thought to be about 0,1 microns. Most wood smoke particles are SMALLER than 1 micron. I live in Northern California and we are pretty much smoked here. I step outside with this mask on and smell ... nothing. When I pull the mask away from my face the campfire smell comes roiling in to match the dirty yellow sky. The fact that this mask blocks them tells me a lot. The tiny-headed Mrs. Js says the ear straps are short and tight: uncomfortable. Her big-cabeza husband has no such problem. I overrule her and say go ahead and buy."
27-Jan-21,Leslie Beale,1,7,1,"I have been buying powecom kn95 masks and they have been great. I just bought 4 new packs of 10 because I work in a lab. And these are NOT the same masks I have been getting. These have 2 layers at most and are the counterfeit kn95s that have the ""kn95"" perforated in. And the green powecom logo has just been stamped onto a counterfeit mask. I have a picture of the one I bought in December vs the one I just bought."
4-Jan-21,V. Williams,5,6,0,"Currently the top review is misleading. While technically sort of true is makes it sounds like there has been some warning issued and that is false. In order to deal with the lack of supply of N95 masks approved for healthcare settings, there is a new program where manufacturers of KN95 masks can submit samples for quality testing. This allows clinics and hospitals as well as individuals to have some reassurance that they are getting a quality product even though it isn’t the gold standard N95. This product is listed as having gone through this voluntary testing which is a good thing though as the review notes, there is a disclaimer that this isn’t the same as meeting the standard for N95 masks. But you probably already knew this wasn’t an N95."
6-Sep-20,norbac,3,7,0,"I know these masks are supposed to be KN95 but they look and feel cheap, especially because they lack the plastic air valve that has made the KN95 masks so ubiquitous.  I've worn them here and there and they appear to do a good job filtering the air and they fit right, but they're just too expensive for the low quality of materials. In regular (let's say, ""non-pandemic"") times, I'm sure these masks would have cost half the price.  It's supply and demand, I suppose, but nonetheless, they're overpriced.  Now, in all fairness to this product, these masks DO NOT have holes! I know several reviewers have complained about this issue.  It appears to have small holes but it's just the marks of the manufacture's heated press to attach the two layers together.  If you get them and try to run a needle or toothpick through those markings you'll notice then that they're not holes at all.  On the plus side, the packet does come with a good allotment of masks.  How often do you need to replace them?  My standard is when they get really stinky..."
28-Dec-20,TJ Land,2,5,0,"Masks came in a plastic bag that wasn’t securely sealed for safety.  Instead it had a flap that folded over some adhesive that could easily be opened & closed. For a product that is supposed to provide protection from a potentially deadly virus, I expected the manufacturer to provide properly sealed packaging that prevents its contents from easily being tampered with. There’s no way of knowing if the masks were not contaminated prior to receiving them because it’s easy to open & close the unsealed plastic bag."
30-Oct-20,pk,5,5,0,"Career medical device engineer here.  To go along with other reviews regarding legitimacy and performance of this mask, it is noteworthy to mention that this mask along with many others has been tested by ECRI, an independent patient safety organization.  This mask passed their tests and photos of it and its packaging may help to confirm its authenticity at least grossly.  Anyone considering this or any other similar mask and has questions regarding performance and validity may do well to visit ECRI at ECRI.org to get a copy of the latest respirator testing summary.  As of this writing the most recent version was published Oct 27, 2020."
13-Jan-21,Andrea D.,2,5,0,"The bag these masks came in was not sealed. A tiny sticker joined the two sides of the plastic bag, but otherwise it was wide open. See photos - 1) bag with tiny sticker folding one side of open bag over. 2) removing tiny sticker to show that the bag was not sealed at all and that the masks are exposed. AND the masks were not in sealed bags inside - they were completely exposed. These masks could have been contaminated, and certainly were not in any way sterile. Also, it took OVER A MONTH to receive this tiny bag of masks - they were supposed to arrive in one week. I know it's a crazy time, but other friends had used other companies and gotten plenty of masks much faster. Luckily, a friend sent me KN95s before I received these in the mail so I didn't have to use them as soon as they arrived, since they were not sealed. I waited a few weeks more and then did use them at Xmas to assist someone in the airport. The masks are very comfortable and breathable and I felt protected in them. And I didn't get sick. But the company needs to seal its product."
28-Dec-20,Dan G,3,4,0,"The masks offer excellent protection. You can feel the air going through the filters instead of just around them (like what the case is with the cheap single use ones). These masks are perfect for a quick run to the store, easy to put on and take off, and can be neatly folded in half and stored in a back pocket or a purse. The problems with them appear when the they are worn for longer than 30min: 1. They are way too tight around the ears. I found myself constantly re-adjusting the straps to get them into that sweet spot where they aren't pulling my ears forward but also do not cut too deep into my skin. 2. Since these masks do not have a dedicated exhaust valve, the air gets filtered a second time on the way out. This is great, since it increases the protection for the people around you, but it also retains the moisture from your breath inside. It's not a problem if you keep the mask on for a short period of time, but it might turn into a problem for any prolonged usage. In conclusion, these masks will be perfect for quick errands but look elsewhere if you need something that you will be wearing the whole day."
6-Sep-20,Doug D,5,6,0,"I have a large face and these masks fit and seal well for me. They are comfortable and seem high quality. They are not terribly difficult to breath through, but they aren't as easy as a cloth mask obviously. I bought these for situations that I feel are particularly high risk that I can't avoid and I think they will work well for that. I really appreciate that they have an authentication sticker that was easy to verify on Powecom's website."
15-Sep-20,D. Jaak,4,4,0,"I've got some old 3M N95 masks (8511 and 8200) lying around to compare these to.  With respect to my face size, they provide very similar restriction when breathing in but also vent above the nose (which could be a little annoying if you wear glasses).  The 3M 8511 solves this problem by venting out of a valve at the bottom of the mask. All of these particulate filtering masks, that fit reasonable well, should make breathing in more difficult.  I have no way to prove that these are legitimate or perform an identical action to the 3M masks, but they appear to filter/restrict air in a very similar way.  When taking off an N95 mask, it is very obvious how much your sense of smell improves immediately.  The same thing occurs to me while wearing these masks.  If they fit your face, these masks are clearly much better than non-filtering surgical masks or anything that I've purchased consisting of cloth.  If you are breathing easy through anything, your filtration is likely also minimal."
23-Nov-20,E. Burke,4,3,0,"Received 2020-11-23. Item arrived with an anti-fake label. The numbers on this label did check out on the Powecom site (though the colors of the numbers didn't match the image displayed on the Powecom site, not sure what's up with that - I'm subtracting one star for that, if only due to creating confusion). The bag also contained a certificate of legitimacy outlining manufacturing date, etc. These appear to be the same masks as the CDC's validated samples under the test report marked '2020-174.2', aside from the text on these being Enlgish rather than Chinese on the CDC site. They match the packaging and product pictured on the Powecom site if you click on the ""KN95 FOLDING MASK"" in the menu on the left. The URL for that page should end with ""eng_product.html"". They are *not* the same as the failing/counterfeit sample marked '2020-174.3'; note the differences in edge stitching (3 square rows for these vs two dashed rows on the failed ones), horizontal ""seams"" (a single unbroken one here vs. dashed on the failed ones), and the earloop attachment (round with a square hash pattern here, two vertical 'stripes' for the failed ones)."
17-Feb-21,Grateful Dave,5,3,0,"I check the FDA list and this company and model are included under the EUA as acceptable. There was an article in todays New York Time about fake KN95s even some using this company's name and branding. So I checked against  their authentication method, including scratching off for a number that you enter on the manufacturers website. as recommended in the article and my masks are authentic. I find then comfortable for what they are. I like the folding design because I can leave it in my jacket pocket or in my glove compartment. Masks with their loops  over the ear masks are thought to have worse seals than over the head.  Though I am sure it varies among people. My only problem  with the otherwise good seal is the  bend in the nose wire leaves a very small opening. That is inevitable with the folding design.  I don't thing that it will increase my risk for daily routines and more populated spots and its better than my cloth masks."
22-Aug-20,K. Zeigler,5,5,0,I love these masks. I am crazy about COVID and check everything. I ran every known test on these masks and they all came up good. I’m a teacher not a healthcare provider And I feel as protected as possible with these masks. 2. I got them sooner than expected which is helpful. 3. I am large and they fit nicely on my face- zero issues. My husband's fit as well. 4. The only issue I had was price. $44 and then literally dropped to $26 the next day. Wasn't happy about that but it's okay. I will reorder.
27-Nov-20,zer0,3,3,0,"For me out of the box, the mask did not form a tight seal around my nose without some adjustments. I could feel the air passing by my eyes when I breathed and exhaled. Also my sunglasses would fog up. What improved the seal was shortening the slack on the ear loops and adjusting the placement of the mask on my chin area. The ear strap seems to be strong enough to allow these modifications. The package came with the chinese certification insert and a scratcher to reveal the QR code. Also, I found the manufacturer (Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies Co., LTD) listed on the FDA approval list dated October 15, 2020. Umbrella EUA for Non-NIOSH-Approved Disposable Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) Manufactured in China. The same manufacturer was listed under the CDC's int'l testing reports, but note that the test was performed back in May 2020."
25-Nov-20,Ashley,3,4,0,"I work as a Covid-19 Screener at a local clinic. I must wear a mask for eight hours a day, five days a week. In the past two weeks, I've had several patients come in who had either been exposed to the virus or were experiencing symptoms. I therefore wanted something more protective than the cheap surgical masks I'm provided - so I ordered these. These have a good fit and a tight seal. The earloops are comfortable in comparison to other brands of KN95s. The mask itself is soft and comfortable. However, after wearing this for four or five hours, it got to the point where I felt I couldn't breathe and was feeling lightheaded. At hour six, I finally had to take it off in exchange for a surgical mask. My opinion? I think these are a great option for short-term (less than three hours) use. I truly believe they're more protective than a surgical mask, gaiter scarf, etc. But I wouldn't recommend them for long-term use."
27-Jan-21,TK1,1,5,1,"Fake masks. The masks are very thin, full of little holes, there are only 3 layers (not 5), the package is not sealed (so anyone can easy keep the originals masks and insert fake ones), no proof of purchase inside, just instructions. Also I read from another customer that the real masks from Powecom come with a black stamp, I guess the fake ones are green. I returned them! This to be comparable with a N95 mask is a joke! Looks even thinner then the disposable surgical masks."
27-Jan-21,Rosebuddy,1,6,1,"I purchased these masks in October and just opened the package. As shown in my photo, there is no printing on the mask to indicate that it is the Powecom mask shown and described for the item. Considering that I purchased these masks based on the details regarding protective qualities, I do not trust them and assume that they are fake."
13-Sep-20,Willie V. Hughes,5,3,0,"I cannot confirm or refute any claims these are these KN95 masks are the Chinese equivalent of American N95 masks, but I can tell you they certainly seem legitimate. They are very high quality, very comfortable, and upon close inspection, they match the construction of some N95 masks I have which were bought a year or two before the Pandemic of 2020. I am going to stop using my surgical style masks because these KN95 masks appear to provide much more protection, and they are comfortable-enough to wear all day. The same cannot be said for some N95 masks I have with two head straps and a pressure valve. Those masks really hurt my nose. These KN95 masks don't do that. PRO TIP: One recommendation I'd make if you're going to wear these KN95 masks-- or any other masks which rely upon straps hooking on the ears, get a silicone strap with buttons/nubs to hook the straps on, to relieve strain on your ears."
13-Jan-21,Customer,5,3,0,"I’ve been wearing these masks for several months now and am very happy not only with the snug fit but the high protection they offer, and the ear loops can be stretched out pretty far with no breakage. For people with asthma and breathing problems: I have asthma and sometimes I’ll get an attack with the mask on. I get panicky thinking there’s not enough air because of this thing pressed against my face...the trick is to calm, relax, and notice that I am getting plenty of air, it’s not affecting my breathing at all. Then I’m ok, use the rescue inhaler if needed for my lungs, or just breathe slowly. The point is that the mask doesn’t inhibit my breathing."
2-Oct-20,jazzfan,5,2,0,"we have used these masks for a while now ... while I cannot say how they fare against virus and pathogens, however I can tell that they make excellent filters for wildfire smoke! I get horrible migraines and respiratory issues on bad air days and thanks to these powecom masks I can still go outside and even hike without issues. These are the only KN95 that will fit my very petite pre-teen daughter ( make an extra knot in the ear loops and it seals and fits better than all the other masks we have tried). I can breathe through the material easily, have gone hiking and biking and my son has used them for sports - by far more comfortable than fabric or surgical masks and also easier to speak with. Honestly ... I don't trust any company at the moment to make true N95 equivalent masks that are available to the public but these are certainly WAY above a fabric or surgical mask as far as seal and comfort goes and that makes them safer . I do not have to touch the mask or adjust the fit as I see so many do with their ill fitting cloth masks and my glasses get less foggy !"
24-Feb-21,vivelelivre,5,2,0,"A review from Aug. 8, 2020, says this mask is not on the CDC's approved list. Perhaps it wasn't then, but it is now per ""Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated February 18, 2021)."" If you purchase it on amazon, there's some risk that it's fake. At the listing in Appendix A of the CDC's list, click on ""IFU"" in the righthand column for instructions on how to verify the authenticity of your purchase.

In fact, the CDC tested 30 Powecom respirators on December 2, 2020 and found the filtration efficiency ranged from 99.35% to 99.64%, which is even better than its required 95% and better than in earlier tests. Based on these results, the Powecom KN95 is our preferred KN95.""  Since there have been some counterfeits sold on Amazon, CL recommends buying the Powecom KN95 from Bona Fide Masks.

24-Jan-21,anon 1,2,4,1,"I received the masks today and was eager to use them. However the package itself does not contain an Anti-Fake sticker so there is no way to check. I'd like to hope that they are real as they fit well and are relatively thick. Cutting one open to see the filtration only shows one inner - somewhat thicker - mesh with a very thin inner layer and a stiffer outer layer. I've been using 3 ply surgical masks from a quality US manufacturer however at this point am concerned with the authenticity of any of these products from online vendors.  Unfortunately unless I want to take a chance, I just threw almost $18 in the garbage. Also, the mask itself has no other markings such as GB2626-2006 on it. Just the KN95 impression."
2-Feb-21,Joyce,2,4,0,"I had high hopes for this mask.  It actually fit my face with a complete seal all the way around.  Breathing was comfortable without the fabric being sucked in and out like some masks.  HOWEVER, the ear loops are small and are not adjustable.  I could stand about 30 minutes in the grocery store before the pain behind my ears was unbearable.  For that reason, I cannot recommend them.  Just FYI, my face is on the small side."

20-Nov-20,Zach,1,3,1,"CONS: -As seen in other's pictures, the masks have perforation holes where the lines in the mask are supposed to be as photographed in the official Amazon photo.  The mask is supposed to be 5 layers ALL the way through.  The ones I received clearly are not. -The codes worked on Powecom's website, but the initial day I got them, the website was down.  And then I've stumbled upon other variations of the website or links inside the website asking for 20 digit codes instead of the 16 digits, so that was confusing.  But I can say that on the straight up powecom website verification check in the top right, my codes worked -Second, the seal was half open on one of my packages.  This might not be so bad if the masks themselves were sealed inside the bag, but they are not.  So there had to have been direct exposure to the masks in transit. -Third, the seal holding the package shut it just like a gluey sticky strip.  Meaning anyone could have opened and tampered with the masks.  I would have felt more comfortable with a completed shut package. POSTIVES: -Sold and Shipped by amazon -Listed on FDA's website as an approved respirator manufactured in china -""Supposedly"" one of the most protective masks other than an N95 currently available So overall from that what you will."
10-Feb-21,Jeff F,5,3,0,"Yes, they are definitely on the FDA EUA list, they are definitely 5 layer, and they even have a secure mechanism to verify that they are not fakes. All of that is gravy given that these masks other literally saved me from a potentially deadly disease. I accidently put them to the true test having spent 8 hrs in the car with my sick college student who was diagnosed with COVID-19 the next day. I wore this KN95 during the drive, and she wore a single layer fabric mask. I did not catch COVID-19 (verified)."
19-Feb-21,DAI,1,5,1,Powecom website shows how to confirm real (red sticker w/ code in pic) from fake. Ordered 3 pkgs from this listing 1 was real and 2 were fake. If you order from this listing its basically luck of the draw.

1-Feb-21,D. R.,4,2,0,"The holes people refer to are NOT holes! There's a layer of what looks like plastic film. It's clear, but it's there. The ear elastics are on the small side. I'm small and female and they're just about right for me. I think a big dude could have problems with fit. The instructions in the box say something about stretching the mask or elastic before wearing, but since they fit I didn't pay too much attention or try stretching them. So maybe that would enable them to work for you mid-range sized folks? Overall, they're comfortable enough and fit nice and snug. I got them as an upgrade from the regular surgical masks I was using. Tried to blow a candle or and couldn't, so they're doing at least that good a job."
8-Feb-21,Stuart Bruce,5,One,0,"I saw my dentist and the staff wearing the Powecom KN95 Face Mask and I asked more about these.  It is so hard to know what is a good KN95, what is fake, etc.  My dentist gave me a 10 pack. I liked the feel, wear and the fact that the brand was sold by a major medical supply company. The next step was to find 'real' Powecom KN95 Face Masks. This is not easy. If it is being sold by and shipped by Amazon I felt good.  I have ordered 3 times and all 3 shipments contained real Powecom KN95 Face Masks that passed the validation tests. What is the validation test?  All Powecom KN95 Face Mask packages have an authorized - anti-tampering bar code type label. You scratch off the bar code area, like a lotto ticket and go to the Powecom website and enter the 16 digit code.  It will tell you if it is a real batch or a fake.  Easy. I see today that I can order masks on Amazon but NOT via Amazon but rather a third party. So I will not order. I suspect the reports of fakes in the reviews are when consumers order via non-authorized retail chains. The Powecom web site has details about what to look for in an authentic Powecom KN95 Face Mask but basically enter the bar code.  You can also find links to the FDA EUA approval for this company. I will keep ordering these from Amazon and other authorized retailers. I will always check the bar code and verify directly with Powecom these are indeed authentic masks. I feel good about the process."
24-Nov-20,JYM,5,2,0,"This mask is an excellent alternative to the N95, since those masks are reserved for our health care workers. N95 masks have been made to protect the wearer from dangerous particles containing viruses that might cause infections This KN95 mask has multi layered protection (I cut it apart to view the inside).  It consists of cotton and layers of “meltblown” polypropylene fibers that form a porous and breathable network. Fibers are said to be electrostatically charged to help block smaller particles that might slip through the holes.  This will protect the wearer  and can also prevent infectious droplets from being transmitted to others. These masks are comfortable because they are lightweight.  Also, the ear loops are thicker than other KN95 masks I have purchased in the past, and therefore don't bind behind my ears. But what I value the most in these masks is the fact that they fit my petite face better than most of the other KN95 masks I have, which are too large. Therefore, they form a better, more proper fit, preventing air leaks around the edges.  I am so impressed with these masks that I just purchased another package of 10.  Also, the price seems to be better than some of the other KN95 masks on the market."
30-Jan-21,Janna,4,One,0,"I plan to use these masks underneath a cloth mask for extra protection. Before wearing, I performed a couple of informal tests to determine their efficacy. First, I did the Bill Nye Science Guy TikTok test where you try blowing out a candle with the mask on. The flame didn't budge no matter how hard I blew or how I tilted my head. The flame stayed rock steady. Second, when I breathed in and out, the mask collapsed around the cheeks. This is another good indication that air cannot enter the mask from the sides. Third, only a small amount of light passes through the mask when held up to the sun or a light. Finally, I still did notice some fogging up of my glasses despite the nose wire strip but to me this is to be expected as no mask is going to be 100% airtight. I put my cloth mask on over the Powecom KN95 mask and felt confident in the extra layer of protection. My only ""gripe"" is that the ear loops felt a bit snug and the mask itself when compared to my old cloth-only mask is definitely a little less soft on the face. However I only plan on wearing the masks for brief periods of time (less than an hour) so any discomfort should be tolerable. The most important feature of the mask is the extra safety provided. I would definitely consider buying these masks again once this supply runs out."
28-Jan-21,M S,1,3,1,"Very uncomfortable.  The elastic pulled my ears. I don’t have a big face. More importantly, I don’t believe these are n95’s.  Too much air goes through the mask. I can smell through it. Additionally, they are all loose in a bag with one fold over side with a tiny sticker to keep it closed.  It’s not sanitary.  I tried scanning the QR code on the sticker. It wouldn’t work. Complete waste of money.  I won’t use them."
3-Feb-21,Andres M.,5,2,0,"As a professional who has been wearing protective equipment for over 30 years I give this mask five stars for comfort and quality. My last KN95s were genuine 3M masks made in China the I was able to get through a friend who is a doctor in Beijing. The 3M fit was too tight, even after wearing the same mask for months to the point that I could not tolerate it after one hour and had to take breaks to remove it. I have worn this mask for couple of hours at once and it was comfortable.  I agree with other reviewers that it will not fit a large face properly. If you know you have a big face do not waste your time or money buying these masks (I am not even sure you can get a large one). The 3M was a tiny bit bigger but I have not seen 3M masks in the regular market, my (chemicals) company is having difficulty getting 3M protective gear these days. I have attached two pictures so you can compare the Powercom to the 3M one which is the standard of the American industry. I overlapped them so you can compare sizes better, the Powercom is on top of the 3M one. And best yet, the Powercom only cost about one dollar and you do not have to buy fifty at a time to get a very decent price."
14-Sep-20,Graham,5,4,0,"I wear one of these for cycling.  I'm in California, so right now I definitely appreciate the smoke filtering as well as the COVID-19 filtering! The fit feels somewhat different from the surgical masks I'd used before.  These masks ""tent up"" over the mouth, which I prefer when I'm cycling, as it feels a little less claustrophobic than having a sweaty mask press on my mouth.  The mask fits snugly and seems to be sealing well around the edges. I've checked the FDA website myself.  The masks aren't on any ""bad"" lists.  Instead these masks are on the ""Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China"" list.  That means they are FDA authorized, but they haven't been specifically NIOSH tested. I'm generally happy with what I'm seeing.  I plan to buy more of these."
22-Jan-21,Phillip C Lee,5,3,0,"We've tried a lot of masks, cloth, paper, etc- and for us these are by far the best. My wife is a teacher so we really needed to find something that was good quality, fits snugly, but is not right up against your mouth so its easier to communicate.  There is one important issue however that several reviewers have discussed: these are small masks. My wife is 5'1 and I'm 5""10. Both of us have fairly small facial features, so the fit was perfect. When I put one on for the first time, I have to stretch the elastic out a bit, but then it fits fine. If you have an average to larger head, these may be too tight! I highly recommend for smallish featured people. In order for the best protection, you need to find a mask that fits very snugly- but at the same time you don't want your ears to hurt after prolonged time, so I realize that makes it difficult. We initially purchased the minimum 10 as a test, and just placed a large order today that should last us for months."
1-Sep-20,Asian-gem,1,8,0,Terrible fit around ears - straps too small!!
17-Feb-21,Nat,1,2,1,"I ordered a set of these masks in early January and everything was fine; when I did the anti-fake check verification process on Powecom's website, the numbers, color of the numbers, and QR code all matched exactly. I ordered another set of these masks a few weeks later in late January and a number of things seemed a little off. The masks looked slightly different, the anti-fake check number was MUCH easier to scrape off the package to see (it had been very hard to do this with the first, genuine, masks that I ordered), and most importantly, when I did the anti-fake check verification process, while the numbers claimed it was a verified set of masks, the color of the numbers and the QR code that Powecom's website showed did NOT match the color of the numbers and QR code on the package. This seems very fishy and that the second order of masks is counterfeit. Which is very disappointing! Amazon refunded my purchase but I really just want some genuine masks like I ordered the first time."
8-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,3,1,"Buyer alert! This is not a genuine Powecom mask. There is no anti-fake label on the back of the package. When entering the sequence number in the back of the package to the manufacturer's website, it shows as error. No ""Powecom"" prints on the actual mask as it shows on Amazon product page or on the manufacturer's website. The mask is tiny! You can see the difference between the product with the other kn95 mask I have on hand. The very right is the other kn95 I have. The middle one is the so claimed Powecom mask. The left is the back of the package that was sent by Amazon. The mask is tiny. It smells weird. Some sort of chemical smell that makes me dizzy. I am certain that this mask is fake and not going to put it on my face."
28-Jan-21,Brett Saylor,4,One,0,"One very important quality of these KN95 masks is knowing that they are not fake or counterfeit. The package comes with an anti-fake label that you can use to verify they actually came from the Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies factory. It has numbers printed on a label hidden by a rub-off coating like a lottery ticket uses, - you rub off the coating, check the numbers on the factory's website, and verify the masks are not fake..However it is VERY difficult to rub off the coating and the numbers are VERY small. It took a great deal of fiddling to rub off the coating but, in my case, the numbers do check out on the factory's website, so the masks are likely legit. I have NOT worn the masks yet, so don't have any feedback about comfort or durability. But they look ""OK"" - not like the old 3M N95 masks you used to get for a buck or two at the hardware store. But now that we are being told to ""double mask"" for protection I am happy to be able to get these."
28-Nov-20,Dr. Chicklet,1,One,1,"The manufacturer listed was Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies Co., Ltd. which is on the approved FDA list reissued on 10/15/20, so the masks if they are from there are legit.  However, the powecom website lists ways that the authenticity of the masks can be determined. The biggest one is an ""anti-fake"" or anti-counterfeit label on each package.  Mine didn't come with one at all.  Completely fake.  I'm returning this for a refund. Another problem is that I tried one of the masks on before checking the authenticity.  It felt wearing like fiberglass. I had the mask for 20 seconds and I got an allergic reaction to it. Please don't try one on until you've verified that the masks you ordered are legit. Update 2/6/21:  Since I returned these I was able to source authentic powecom KN95 masks that had the anti-fake sticker with numbers that were found on the website.  The difference between the 2 while wearing is instantly noticeable.  Please be careful when buying these masks."
27-Oct-20,Teddy,2,2,0,"These have a good filtering material and are pretty comfortable to wear but having used several n95 brands these come up short next to all of them in protection simply because it’s nearly impossible to get a good seal on the face. The bands on the Ear are not tight enough unless your ears were on the back of your head, a clip to pull them farther towards the back of head would help in this area however. The hardest place to seal with masks is around the nose which is why the best masks always have some sort of foam or rubber type seal to help form around the nose. Even making the perfect shape with the metal strips to your nose without enough force applied or a good sealing foam or rubber strip you can’t expect good protection if a large portion of the air you breath in and out simply goes around the filtering material, and additionally if you wear glasses they will fog up without a seal. So until they fix the sealing issue these are probably about as good as a banana or cloth covering but if you really want to protect yourself and others look for a mask with some sort of seal for the nose and if the straps are on the ears instead of behind the head you should get a clip or something that can pull it tighter to the face unless it’s a very tight strap to begin with. Still these are better than nothing, stay safe, stay healthy."
25-Jan-21,tn,5,4,0,"I always wear these when I am shopping or indoors somewhere like the doctor's office. They are thick and have very fine ""pores"" so no (or few?) germs can get in. Happy with this product. Also fits snugly on the face so no germs are sneaking in the sides which sometimes happens with the three-ply ones. I feel safe wearing these."
20-Feb-21,Luke,5,One,0,"Started a new job that is currently remote, but had to train in the office for the first week. The gal who trained me my last day in office came down with COVID symptoms that evening and tested positive the next day. I was in the same room with her for nine hours. I wore this mask that day, and did not get COVID during my two weeks of self-quarantine after. This mask prevented me from catching COVID. Have read that these KN95s are about the best face masks you can get outside of being a healthcare worker. They’re not as good as the N95s I’m sure, although they seal around your nose and mouth much, much better than the regular flimsy surgical masks. These can get uncomfortable, especially around your ears and nose during extended use, although I would definitely take that over getting COVID any day. I’m really disappointed these seem to be sold out for now, and luckily I bought extras when I did. If and when these come back in stock, buy them! They can save you from getting COVID!"
29-Jan-21,KatieBee,1,2,1,Well which one is the counterfeit? Mask on left arrived to one house 2 days ago but the code I entered on Powecom is not valid; has 4 layers. Mask on right arrived to our other home today. Sticker code matches Powecom website but does not have the Powecom embossing on the mask. Also 4 layers. Neither has the same fusing design. Both have a sticker SKU code (same SKU) over the original SKU. So what’s the deal? Are neither real? Neither mask has round fixtures where the ear bands attach. Buyer beware!
20-Oct-20,sj,3,4,0,"I’m torn. These are on the FDA approved list, and they’re not on any banned lists as some review claims. They are quite comfortable. The authentication checks out. They seem really good...but the review that say light shines through thinner areas are also correct. It does shine through, and not on a part of the mask that presses against your face, the thinner parts are right across the breathing parts of the face. It doesn’t seem right. I am not sure if they will work as hoped or leave gaps for virus to sail through. Would the person with the microscope please take a look at those thinner channels?"
22-Dec-20,RRR,5,One,0,"Before i review the mask i have to say the seller Innovate is awesome. Stupid USPS lost another package for me and their customer service would not help. Amazon contacted Innovate and they messaged me quickly and after verifying USPS lost it they shipped me another one free of charge with FedEx. Most sellers would ship it back with USPS but they went the extra mile. The masks have a good seal, are very comfortable to wear, and easy to breathe in. These are definitely thicker and better than the standard surgical masks but the 3M N95 masks may be a bit thicker but those are reserved for essential workers. I would definitely recommend them. The only criticism i have would be that i wish it was maybe a 1/4 inch longer on the bottom so it doesn't slide off the chin if you move your head a lot."
3-Oct-20,Anne,1,5,1,These are not kn95 masks. They are extremely small and very thin. I have a small face and they fit me but for most adults will be too small. Have to add an additional face mask to feel confident I have the needed protection.
29-Jan-21,diamonddave247,5,One,0,"Okay, so let me share what I believe about these masks. This is just my opinion based on what I've seen and read online. Powecom has been manufacturing these masks in China for some time now. Way before Covid-19 was around, and way before exporting masks to countries all around the world. In that time, there have been many different packages for these very same masks. Some of the older packaging states: ""Non-medical"" written under the KN95 label, newer packaging was created around May of 2020 and has: ""GB2626-2006"" written under the KN95 labeling (see attached photos). The newer packaging MAY or MAY NOT have the anti-counterfeit sticker to help identify fake products. A single pack of 10 masks would most likely have the sticker, but if the single pack of 10 was part of a large case of 12 packs, or an even larger case of 120 packs, the anti-counterfeit sticker would have been placed OUTSIDE THE LARGER BOX ONLY, and NOT on the individual packs found within the case (as per Powecom's website info). Since most 3rd party sellers buy items in bulk or in cases, it is to be expected that a single pack of 10 would NOT have a sticker on it. In any event, the sticker still DOES NOT guarantee you have purchased a genuine product, and the lack of a sticker DOES NOT mean you purchased a counterfeit, either. The best way to tell if your item is of good quality and genuine is to compare the design itself to the pictured product found on Powecom's website. Counterfeits will not look exactly like the company's product, and differences can be pretty easily detected. Keep in mind that the genuine printed logo on the mask, may be a different color, or have slightly different wording, but it may still be a Powecom KN95 mask. What you really want to compare is parts of the actual design and features of the mask itself. Not just the logo. Recent buyers have also complained about cheaper mask ""quality"" and ""feel"" as possible indicators of a counterfeit mask, but keep in mind that due to the pandemic, and high demand, and lack of resources, and available work force, some of the product finishing quality may have been sacrificed in an effort to produce more masks quickly. It is even possible that a protective layer may have been dropped (from 5 layers to 4 layers) in this same effort. This layer removal may have reduced the filtration efficiency from as high as 99%, down to an acceptable and advertised level of 95%. Still quite effective against a virus. I'm not a mask expert, nor do I claim to be, but I only share these observations in an effort to help others better determine whether they have a genuine mask or a counterfeit, and clear up some confusion. If you have doubts about your purchase, by all means, arrange to return your masks for a refund and for a product you trust. I'm confident that I've purchased and received genuine Powecom KN95 masks on 3 different occasions from Amazon.com. Again, this is just my opinion, for whatever it's worth. Stay safe and stay healthy."
28-Jan-21,RestWeb,1,3,1,"The masks I received are counterfeits. The real masks have printed logo and rating, as shown by product images. The received masks have KN95 stamped into the side, no printed ratings, and no holographic seal on the bag. The bag itself looks real, as do the instructions inside, but the 10 masks are counterfeit. Sold directly by Amazon.com."
7-Feb-21,aaradia,1,One,1,"I was happy with this product, thinking I did my research. But I went on here today to re-order and realized my package did NOT have the anti-counterfeit sticker. So, I used it yesterday and another time thinking I was being safe, but I may have put my life at risk using a counterfeit product. If they are not legit, they look exactly like the pictures. Green writing stamped on mask and all. It may be I got the legit product. But since it didn't have the sticker, I can't trust that. The headband style I ordered DID have the anti-counterfeit sticker. I verified them. So I ordered another package of those. Just got off chat with Amazon. Getting my money back. But that doesn't change the fact that I put my health at risk trusting Amazon to not have counterfeit products. My order was fulfilled by Amazon. They promised to escalate my concern. I hope to hear they are going to take additional safety measures regarding getting real product ordered."
22-Nov-20,Me,3,2,1,"My masks matched the picture and look legit. But on the serial number check I got the message ""Hello.The security numbers were already checked.The first query time is at 2020-11-23 00:27:34. These numbers were already verified by 3 times. Beware of fake product IF previous checkings were Not done by you."" I'm not sure what to make of it. It's hard to know if I have the real thing and some other fakes are using this same serial number or if mine are fake."
6-Feb-21,REBECCA,5,,0,"Efficacy: I researched this this as well as I could. Google CDC.gov testing results Powecom Labor KN95 mask. Their results indicate that this mask provides the claimed filtration. Note that presence on the FDA list doesn't mean approval (or disapproval)  and that CDC test ratings don't indicate NIOSH approval or lack thereof.  NIOSH hasn't approved (or disapproved) any KN95s at this point. These ARE approved in Europe. Home tests: I was unable to even make a lighter flame flicker and no water passes through so it passed those tests. Comfort and fit: I'm used to my very excellent 3 layer mask with filter from New Zealand and these aren't as comfortable. I had to fiddle to keep air from escaping on the sides and around the nosepiece, but eventually figured out how. If I were a front line worker (I'm not - just want to be as protected as possible when I can be when I do go out) I'd combine this with a good cloth mask. For me it's more comfortable with one underneath anyway as the edges are kind of scratchy.  I think it's a good guess that that combo is quite protective and for my purposes probably overkill. Unless the new super-contagious COVID strain gets roaring. From what I can figure out from reading these are probably fairly equivalent to N95s. Some articles from reliable sources quoted doctors who are using KN95's and trust them - two such sites provided a link to this particular  model as authentic.  Nothing's certain in this new world, but I'm thinking these are authentic and effective."
28-Jul-20,Deb G,5,7,0,Nice masks. My wife says That they fit great.
1-Feb-21,Shinjaejun,3,One,1,"I ordered 2 of these. 1 bag was genuine with anti-fake label and masks with green print only. The 2nd bag had no anti-fake label and the masks inside were a bit different with kn95 stamped into the mask which the real ones didn't have. The real ones don't fit tight enough. American made real n95 will leave a dent in your face if fitted properly. These Chinese ones have a slight gap at the top no matter what I do, so air escaped and fogs my glasses. I have to use ear loop adjusters to get the mask tight enough around the rest of my face. I do not have a small face, and these are definitely not kid sized. Will be returning the fakes, probably won't buy again because it's a crapshoot."
24-Feb-21,CrosshairXFiDew,3,,0,"NOT tight around nose as claimed... ""Metal strip"" is very thin Have used multiple masks... I prefer over head and back of head straps... This is behind ear... Typically I have to get large hats as my head is average, perhaps little larger then average. However this mask feels a bit loose... If I go for a good walk outdoors it gets very damp inside the mask in the winter... And my glasses fog up REAL bad. It is packaged very nicely... Elastic seems fairly decent quality Again - it does not hold tight on my face... And if breathing heavily from a very fast walk... It will slide down my nose (basically making it useless for any kind of physical activity). One nice thing... It folds flat... Thus easy to carry with me... Vs the ""dome/circle"" design of other masks... Thus .. I would ONLY recommend this as a ""failsafe"" mask in a car... Purse... Etc... As while it is better then the generic blue ""imitation surgical masks""... Better basically just means it is shaped a bit like a face... Vs a rectangle. Long story short.... Not comfortable, not tight seal even on larger heads, slides down easily... But is very portable... So... Better then nothing, but I will stick with my ""dome/sphere"" shapes ones that actually seal fairly well"
8-Sep-20,Sean E.,4,4,0,First off a positive. Very comfortable. I’m 6’ 215 and they fit me well. A little tight on ears but from experience it’s to be expected with some masks. It’s the thickness/quality I question. Very light weight almost too much so. And to the touch are very thin compared to others I have. Now the secret maybe in the material but to the eye test not impressed with thickness. I’ll wear but won’t be my go to.
24-Feb-21,Barbara Krall,4,2,0,"I read at least one comment that these are a good fit for a smaller face (5'1"" petite female, 120 lbs), so based on that and all the other info, I bought 20 masks.  I was slightly disappointed that the masks are a bit bigger than anticipated, certainly slightly bigger than other KN95s I've used.  Ear loops are a tad too long, had to knot elastic for a tighter fit.  Sides of masks don't fit as snugly as other KN95s, so I'm downgrading overall to 4 stars. Otherwise quality and construction is excellent, but based on fit, I will probably not order these masks again.  If you are bigger than me, mask will probably fit just fine. It works well to layer the Powecom over a pleated blue surgical mask."
2-Oct-20,Phil,1,4,1,These are COUNTERFEIT. Do not buy them. They are different packaging than the real Powecom and are missing the verification seal. SCAM.
11-Mar-21,P. Kingsriter,4,,0,"I work in healthcare and have been exposed to dozens of masks and respirators in the last year.  This mask appears to be a great value with one caveat.  First, the good: Good:  They fit a variety of face sizes and shapes well, getting a good seal around the edges that is snug, secure, but relatively comfortable.  Using a flashlight test for thickness, they're pretty robust, blocking more light than several layers of cloth and double a standard paper mask.  You'll not be able to blow out a candle with this mask on, so it blocks the movement of air well, too.  I would venture to say that these masks are a good alternative to ""double-masking"".  They're also significantly more comfortable than a standard ""N95"" (but probably don't provide the same high-level of filtration). The not-so-good:  The ear loops are uncomfortable.  They produced significant headaches after several hours of wear.  We had to purchase ear loop extender straps (which work great) in order to make these masks wearable. Overall, they provide a good value and (I would guess) decent filtration.  Just be prepared to pick up some ear loop extensions to go with them."
28-Sep-20,Bobby L,5,One,0,"I have done a lot of research on various masks, and I have to say I really love these. Not only are they on the FDA Emergency Use list, but they also have the nice feature of the anti-counterfeit tag on the package. They are also extremely comfortable on the face. Light weight, yet you feel very secure that it's thickness and filtration rate. It fits securely enough so that you feel the mask inhale & exhale. It's very breathable, and can be worn for extended periods without feeling like you need air. Price is also very affordable too. Seems like about the next best thing to an N95 that you can get out there when you consider the quality and price."
14-Nov-20,Teresa Alvarez,3,3,1,"I have used KN95 masks, so I have to say that these specific masks that I received, felt like a copy cat of the real KN95. It is too thin, and poor smoke filter. During wildfires and dust storm, this masks left me down."
18-Feb-21,Nidan Jutsu,5,,0,"I thoroughly researched before purchasing these. We've been cleaning and reusing them with the ""sous vide"" function and our Instant Pot via the U.S. government method. I checked our pics with the various ones here, and they are genuine. We run the 30 minute cycle sometimes 2 or more times per day. I am going to order another pack (and check for authenticity.) We are going to put the recleaned ones in a separate zip loc bag with a hash mark for every 10 cleaned (you could clean them up to 20X with original filtration effectiveness.) We used to wear face shields, but we are confident wearing these with homemade face masks -- even though it's not recommended to combine KN95 with other masks. Mine seals tightly to my face, and I can feel it adhering to my face when I suck in. It seems a bit big for my wife's face, though (she is a 5' 0"" Filipina / petite)-- so she puts it over her homemade mask. I loosely put my homemade mask over this one -- careful not to have it change the shape or seal -- which is oh so critical."
22-Nov-20,VJ,2,One,1,"I purchased this mask for two reasons: 1) The pictures on Amazon show the mask having sealed seams on the front instead of semi-transparent holes/squares (like most other KN95s on the market). See the photo in this review. 2) It has a verified filtration rate by the CDC’s lab affiliate, NPPTL. I was extremely disappointed because the masks I received have the semi-transparent holes on the front instead of the sealed seams. I received them the day before I needed them and had no time to order from a different manufacturer. This seller needs to update their photos on Amazon."
18-Feb-21,M. W. Clayton,1,2,1,"ABSOLUTELY NOT KN95 MASKS!!!! SEE PICTURES!!!! NOT JUST FALSE ADVERTISING BUT POTENTIALLY DEADLY LIE!!!! Not even close to those pictured!!

Seller does not accept returns so 20 masks that are completely useless!!"
27-Nov-20,Dana W.,1,2,0,"I have used several packages of these KN95 masks, and found them to be very functional and a good fit for my smaller face. Last week, I received another 10-pack. The masks I received are smaller, a tighter fit, the ear loops are thicker and less springy, the mask does not pass air well at all, there is a stronger (than usual) odor, and  my face immediately developed a rash. Fortunately, a couple days later, I received another 10-pack I had ordered a couple of weeks ago that were not Prime shipped, and so took longer to get to me. The masks in that package are like the ones I have been using, except that there is no orange manufacturer's label on the face of the mask. In comparing the two shipments, the differences were very clear. I hope that Amazon can quickly get to the bottom of this issue, and be able to continue supplying safe KN95 masks. Still, BUYER BEWARE."
4-Apr-21,Saoirse,3,,0,"So, I bought these because I work in a restaurant and I am around maskless customers all shift. I was hoping for a mask better than the cloth ones I had been wearing. However, these caused my face shield, and glasses when not wearing the shield, to fog up, which shows they are not filtering effectively. Some of my cloth masks do this, too, and some don't. So I started wearing one of these and one cloth mask together, and most of the time this has been effective at stopping the fogging up problem as long as I wear contacts with the shield and not my glasses (happens I forgot my contacts the other day and it was a pain- shield and glasses kept fogging bad no matter if I wore just one mask, or both). Would I buy these again? Probably not... I am going to keep looking for a good mask that seals well and doesn't cause fogging. The earloops were a bit tight and caused my ears to be a bit sore at the end of my shift, not as bad as some masks I've worn, but uncomfortable nonetheless."
3-Sep-20,primerdame,5,2,0,"This mask was real and verified. It arrived sooner than expected. The mask fits very well and right to my face but does pull on my ears. But, I will take a little ear soreness over COVID or the flu any day! I was easily able to walk at my normal fast pace for 8+ hours even with some of those hours daily in 90+ heat and never felt out of breath. I find it works better than my fit tested 3M N95. I would buy more just to have extra but I have enough."
2-Dec-20,An astute shopper,5,,0,"Do NOT believe any negative reviews! I just received my second order of 10 of these masks just to have on hand for the future when needed.  They fit beautifully..... no matter the size of your face.  I actually make knots on the elastics around the ears so it fits a bit tighter.  My husband finds the size perfect. We are both tall, big people, so if anyone says they are for good for only a small face, that is total nonsense.  I feel these fit much tighter to the face than the cheap blue non-medical masks which you see all over.  I have plenty of those too, but now that I found these, I feel these are more effective!  It says they are currently unavailable for order, but keep checking and see if they come back. I'm doing that myself because as soon as I see they are back, I'll order my third package of 10!!! The first batch I got was $25 and the second was only $17!!! BUY ASAP!!! I am a hugeeeee Amazon shopper and have written many reviews for those products that I love and recommend with no ulterior motive whatsoever!!!!"
25-Aug-20,Nemo,1,7,0,not as good a quality as items costing half as much.
9-Sep-20,R. SELIG,4,2,0,"These masks with over-the-ear laces have an air space before the face which reduces the breathing problems I have found with other N95 masks.  It must be remembered however that plain masks are intended to stop the wearer from spreading infection to others.  They do not offer protection to the wearer.  For that, a shield, an impermeable,  physical barrier is required."
16-Dec-20,Repro63,5,,0,"I am not a doctor, nor have any way to prove that these work better the anything else. I have read up a lot on masks and safety. The KN95 masks are supposed to provide a really good level of safety from airborne or air transmitted diseases. They are on the governments list for emergency use and for that, they are approved. I checked it out. The masks come packaged and have a hologram seal with production lot information, date and manufacturer. It all looks official and safe. You can really tell the difference when wearing them. They seal around your face and nose, and you can feel the resistance when breathing through them. I have lots of the cheap hospital masks left over, and as a precaution, I wear them over the KN95 masks as an additional barrier. Can't hurt. The masks can be re-used. Once they produce an odd smell when I put it on, I dispose of it and get a new one. I feel better wearing them and can recommend them as well. I give them 5 stars."
21-Aug-20,Coffee Ghost,5,3,0,Now this is a great mask and cheaper then I though it would be. The cloth masks and non medical mask are so thin sometimes I worry they are protecting me enough. This is a great quality mask and it’s verifiable as a genuine guaranteed product for KN95. Would recommend for an extra layer of safety.
24-Jan-21,Jesse & Elizabeth,5,4,0,As comfortable as your going to get. It’s good if it’s right fitting and making marks on your face. I am not very knowledgeable on KN95 masks but it’s better than nothing and might be the closest we’ll get to N95’s
24-Nov-20,I tried it,1,One,1,"Really disappointed in this product that has so many high reviews! Complete waste of money! It's simple, if your glasses fog then air is leaking out, if air leaks out it can come in. If unfiltered air can come in so can the droplets that carry the viruses we are trying to avoid. The reinforcement wire for shaping around the nose is very weak and has no foam to provide a better fit and prevent leaks. Also they're extremely thin material compared to real N95 masks. You might as well wear the cheap blue procedural masks if you're only worried meeting the mask mandate. These aren't any better IMO."
1-Feb-21,CM,5,One,0,"Fit is good. Ear loops feel only a little snug after wearing for a while. I can alleviate that with detachable straps. These appear to be authentic. I confirmed on the FDA website that Powecom is an approved K95 supplier and verified the QR code on the package seal. I did a little test with a lit match to see if the ""holes"" that people keep commenting on are really open. They are not. I could not blow out the flame from 2 inches away, whether inhaling or exhaling heavily. The ""holes"" are obviously just seals where the layers are compressed."
15-Dec-20,Simon,5,,0,"Other Amazon reviews state that the PoweCom KN95 masks are not good or not on the US government emergency list or failed test.  Only partially correct.  A set of PoweCom KN95 masks did fail a test; However other sets were tested and did PASS the test!  The CDC list can be confusing to read and the Chinese names can get a little confusing. The materials and the construction of the PoweCom masks that I received appeared to me to be of very good quality.  The masks fitted me very tight,  perhaps a little too tight around my ears.  Fit probably depends on where your ears are on your head.  I do not know if the masks is available in different sizes.  I would estimate that the size was a 'small' or 'medium'.  If you are taller or big person, the masks maybe a little small for you.  Check to see if other sizes are available, i.e. large. Would recommend and purchase again."
4-Feb-21,Bobbo,4,2,0,"Definitely on the approved list: Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated with Administrative Changes or Respirator Model Removals: October 15, 2020.) Listed as:  Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies Co., LTD Shape gives my lips and nostrils room to breathe. Nose bridge forms well keeping glasses from fogging. Tight ear loops keep the mask snug around the sides making it effective in filtering out junk.  Problem is that my poor ears are sore by the end of the day.  I wish that KN95’s offer around the head bands like real N95’s."
1-Jan-21,I. Mori,1,5,1,"These KN95 masks are fake.  No authenticity scratch-off seal, no printing on the mask indicating it's a KN95, just  a pack of 10 plain white masks.  Will be returning."
29-Sep-20,Scott West,5,2,0,"I have been wearing masks since before they became  popular and these are by far the best! I just re-ordered more today. I am considered ""high risk"" due to medical conditions including the need for oxygen 24/7.  They fit perfectly to my face even with my oxygen canula. The ear loops are soft so they don't irritate. There is plenty of room inside and my glasses don't get foggy. They arrived earlier than expected so that was a plus and the customer service is outstanding. I highly recommend this product! UPDATE: Just received my second shipment and the quality remains! Great mask, great value!"
2-Sep-20,Reviewer,1,5,1,They just colapse onto themselves when you put them on. Really crappy. Their “QR” code is a farse.
26-Jan-21,Gemma Sunnergren,2,5,0,"Package was open and only contained 9 masks - not 10.  Not exactly reassuring as to cleanliness, let alone not getting all the masks I paid for."
29-Sep-20,Darion,5,2,0,"Purchased these and got an email from the seller on how to verify them with a unique code on the pack; it verified they are authentic. I'm not a mask expert, but they feel well made. Keep in mind these are made to be disposable; I bought them for high risk situations (indoors/air travel/etc) and will throw them out after use. Stay safe!"
15-Dec-20,John Wesley Rattner,1,2,1,"Consumer Labs has a warning about counterfeit masks. Everything on the outside of the package seemed to meet their standards, the certification, etc., but when opened I discovered that the masks did not have the certification was printed on them as CL said. That is, on the outside of the package you'll see ""STANDARD: GB2626 -2006 KN95"" but the masks do not have the colored print stating the same standard."
10-Dec-20,Donald Balfour,5,,0,"This mask fits tight and comfortable.  You can tell it's doing a good job, and has held up exceptionally well.  Since sunlight kills all bacteria related to any virus, after getting in my car after wearing it somewhere, I set it on my dash board and the sun disinfects it as I drive to my next destination.  If you take care of it, regardless of people saying you should discard often, this mask holds up well, and if you keep it clean by not throwing it just anywhere, you'll keep it for weeks or more before it's not usable.  I've used mine for almost a month, it's clean, sun disinfected, and still like new. It's got the higher KN95 rating so you know you're getting great protection.  Don't be disturbed because its make in China, almost all masks worn for the past twenty years have been made there, and these are quality well made.  Just my experience, hope my review helps."
29-Sep-20,Peter A. Butzin,5,One,0,"My understanding is that KN95 masks ""attempt"" to meet FDA requirements for N95 masks. I would have preferred purchasing genuine N95 masks, but they are unavailable. So, these ""made in China"" are the only alternative. There is no way for me to confirm that they are as effective as N95 masks, but, since this is the best available, I'm hoping that they work. If I don't check back in a few months due to the pandemic, consider that I died and would no longer recommend the product."
2-Feb-21,Jeff Dreyfous,4,,0,"This would be a 5 star product if they would do away with the ear loops and replace them with the 3M n95 Respirator head loops. The ear loops are just a bit short and make your ears bend forward and hurt in short order. As a former Safety Director, Handyman Service Owner/Operator and avid DIY guy, the full head loops give a better fit hands down! The cost to attach premium full elastic head loops is insignificant to the overall cost to manufacture these masks, and produce a far superior product. I don't know who started the ear loop method of securing any mask, but they should either do away with it or offer both styles. Personally I would be glad to pay a little more for full head loops to get a better fit and more control over potential air gaps around my face. Make the change and you will get 5 stars from this user!"
13-Feb-21,KTown,2,One,0,"My head is not big and my petite wife certainly has a small head. The loops were too small. I have had many N95 and recently KN95 and not had this problem. I double checked the package and they were not listed as child size.  The filter area was appropriate for an adult. For me, as I wear glasses, they pulled my ears forward. My wife said for her about 30 minutes was all she could stand. Very disappointed. The rest of the mask seemed well made, the metal clip over the bridge worked well and the mask fit over our face."
26-Sep-20,James R Spink,5,2,0,"I first encountered these particular masks while visiting my dentist’s office for a routine cleaning and decided to give them a try.  I needed something I could comfortably wear all day at my job that would protect me better than a flimsy paper mask.  I have been very happy with this choice.  It is comfortable, fits reasonably snugly for my large (if you look at hat size) head, and seems to work as advertised.  My glasses do not fog up while wearing the mask. I have ordered some for my sons and plan to continue to use these daily on the job. I realize that KN95s are not the equivalent of N95s, but these are readIly available, affordable, and a good option."
26-Dec-20,zen800,4,,0,"These offer better protection than surgical or cloth masks, and I believe the manufacturer is approved as stated in the listing. However, although I'm small in size, the ear loops are very small on these, and cause my ears to bend forward, which is painful and looks terrible. I have to use extension band to wear these. Every way I've tried them, they are not a complete seal. I can't imagine how a normal sized person can comfortably use the loops without elastic extensions, I found a pack of 4 on Amazon for a few dollars. I still think these are some of the better masks on the market however. If you're in an area where covid is an issue, I believe these will keep you safer than cloth or surgical masks. You’ll probably need to get elastic extensions or add something to the loops so they can tie around to back of the head."
2-Feb-21,WB Halper,5,One,0,"These masks are very comfortable, fit well and last a long time.  This is my fourth order for Powecom masks.  My family and I are wearing them daily. It should be noted that these are listed on the FDA web site as receiving authorization under the Covid-19 EUA.  Search for ""Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China"" for more information.  Powecom also has it's own web site that tells about the company.  They make an impressive number of masks each day..."
1-Oct-20,Steven Manilov,5,2,0,"These masks are approved by FDA and you can authenticate them by using their serial number.  This is important because there are many KN95 masks that don't meet KN95 standard (fakes). These masks fit my face well, but don't fit my wife or my son (too big).  It's important to find a mask that fits snugly against your face.  These are best for me."
12-Oct-20,Susan ML,3,3,1,"I received these today and was disappointed when the label did not scan so I can only assume that these are fake masks. This is disappointing, everything on the label seemed genuine."
10-Dec-20,J Russ,5,,0,"This appears to be a good, basic KN95 mask. There is a difference between N95 masks and KN95, but this mask should have protective qualities with its meltblown layer and heat-sealed edges. Check to see the FDA's current list on ""bad"" or recalled KN95 masks, but when I checked this mask was not on that list (two other Powecom masks were, but not this one). The nose piece is bendable, the ear loops are better than many I've tried, and the layering appears adequate. To get more wear out of each mask (set them aside to ""air"" for at least 3 days between wearings--and follow the instructions when it says not to wash, steam, etc.), you can wear a cloth or surgical mask over it (wash the cloth mask and dispose of the surgical mask).  Not all KN95s are created equal, so always research the one you are considering."
25-Feb-21,Liz L.,1,One,0,"My impression of the recommendations of The Cut at NY magazine is that they are completely useless and unreliable and mostly written by idiots. These people will recommend ANYTHING that will result in a commission for NY Mag. I have now bought like 15 different types of masks, and this one was the very worst. It is made for a miniature person. If your head is in the normal to large range, this mask will nearly take your ears off, it is so absurdly tight. The mask itself is also tiny. Would never, ever buy again."
31-Dec-20,H. Pierce,1,3,0,"After receiving the product sold from and shipped by Amazon, the anti-fake label was not scrapable.  And the package didn't meet the new product ID.  The product label for old product had (Non-medical) under the KN95/Protective mask label where as the EUA approved product has GB-2626-2006 instead of (Non-medical)."
3-Feb-21,Tea on the Veranda,5,2,0,It took a bit of research but Guangzhou Powecom IS on the approved FDA/CDC list. There are other manufacturers that begin with Guangzhou which have been removed but as of 2.3.21 Powecom is not one of them. As a sidenote approved N95 masks are available in the paint department at many local hardware stores.
26-Nov-20,j. garrett,1,3,1,"DO NOT TRUST THESE AT ALL.  I opened my 10-mask package and examined a mask for signs that a respirator may be counterfeit (signs listed on CDC website).  Upon quick examination, the mask does not have ANY marking at all on the outside--the first CDC-listed sign for counterfeit.  It is NOT like the photo of the product!  It also does not have any approval (TC) number on it--the second CDC-listed sign.  RETURN IS COSTING ME $11.98 in shipping!!!!"
5-Nov-20,Nancy,5,One,0,"I'm kind of an average size woman, 5'5"", and some masks have been too large for me. This one fit me well everywhere: over the bridge of the nose, along the sides of the face, and under the chin. The elastic ear straps are comfortable but I have to stretch them out a little to be loose enough over the ears. I read that having a larger surface area to your mask and having space between your face and the mask are better for good filtration. This style has that. It's important to me that this brand of KN95 received the FDA emergency authorization. It's my favorite mask so far! I've put away the rest of my masks. I got my husband the JiaDaiFu KN95 and it fits him well - that brand was too big for me."
6-Mar-21,Laurie A Nicholson,1,3,1,"Sure it had comfort and  fit but as far as FDA approved? I did a light test using my cell phone as recommended  on the news and light was clear  cut right through it. FDA approved, I doughty it."
6-Feb-21,bookworm,5,One,0,"These masks are excellent quality. They fit well and are comfortable. They are KN95 masks and therefore have not been tested using U.S. standards for N95 masks. I have purchased several and each has been good quality. The CDC posts very limited testing of ""International Assessment Results – Not NIOSH-approved"" masks. The CDC lists these masks as being tested 10 times (10 masks each time). All of their tests showed greater than 97% filtration except one, which showed 93% to 94.87% filtration. That set of 10 masks was placed on the misuse of company name list. I'm personally ok with 90% of the masks having better than 97% filtration, knowing that I may occasionally get a mask with 93% filtration. However, Powecom does need to ensure 95% filtration, if that's what they are claiming."
7-Mar-21,Gary O,1,3,1,I already submitted one review factual review on NIOSH rating and FDA approvals.  However Amazon blocked the review.  Buyer beware. A lot of false information is in the ad for this product.  You get what you pay for.
18-Feb-21,PG in NC,5,One,0,"With KN95 masks seemingly becoming the de facto best COVID protective face covering for non-medical workers, and based on a New York Times article, I ordered a bag of ten of these.  Then, I began to read all the stories about counterfeit masks...hard to believe how many non-ethical people exist in this world.  Be that as it may, the masks did arrive with an anti-fake sticker, the bottom part is like a lottery ticket...easy to scratch off the silver layer, and under that is a number.  I went  to the Powecom web site, entered the number, and it confirmed that the masks were legit.  No question it's a bit more difficult to breathe with these, but not suffocating by any means.  And since they are NOT N-95's with a totally airtight fit, when I have my reading glasses on, and expire fully, they fog a bit.  However, the masks otherwise provide a much more complete around-the-nose-and-mouth fit than the blue surgical masks we had been using.  And now that we have received two Pfizer vaccines, hope that masking and the vaccines will keep us and others safe until the pandemic passes."
2-Dec-20,Darren,4,,0,"I've received 4 packs of these in three shipments.  Two packs just received Dec. 2020 were sold/shipped by Amazon via Prime (but the UPS shipment was actually listed from ""Diagnostics Direct"") and one pack sold by Innovate Tech from received in September.  These three all had nearly identical packaging with very slight differences and all three had the anti-fake text and QR code seal, though the seals varied slightly as well.  The last pack, also sold/shipped by Amazon and received in early November did not have the seal and on the front said (Non Medical).  I'm not certain it is a fake.  I'd be more inclined to believe that Amazon bought different batches with different packaging from the same manufacturer. When these are under $20 for 10, they are a decent value.  They do appear to be on the FDA emergency use ""Appendix A"" list, but of course who knows if the product sent to the FDA has changed over time like the packaging.  They seem to be comfortable enough, the elastic  loops are on the shorter side but keep the mask snug.  No other complaints."
21-Nov-20,nazelah,5,3,0,"I've gone through about a dozen various kinds of masks since March - my face is small, and it's been almost impossible to find one that for properly. This one actually fits snugly enough, and doesn't fogup my glasses. I wanted an N95 type mask (wanted to leave the actual N95s for med professionals), and I chose this one at random. But then I looked up this brand, and it turns out it's FDA-approved. Bonus!"
30-Oct-20,TC,5,,0,"I thought I reviewed this already but I guess I didn't. This is one of the best of the kn95 masks in my opinion. It is on the proper lists and while not as good as a true n95 mask, it's darn close. They make hooks to attach the two ear Loops together rather than have them squeeze at the back of your ears. They sell them here on Amazon. I use them to pull this snug to my face and it works quite well. The difference I find between this and the true n95 masks is that the nose piece is a little soft. That means if you pull the mask tight to your face it can flatten out the metal bar that goes across the bridge of the nose which would leave gaps on either side of nose. I made a change to mine by adding another piece of metal."
4-Aug-20,Javier,5,4,0,"Fit very well, infinitely better than surgical mask, excellent fit, even better than the N95 we have. FDA tested. Easier to breath and work well with goggles. This will be my goto mask if we need more."
7-Oct-20,Gail M,5,One,0,"Would give these 10 stars. I’ve got blue paper masks, Costco masks, cute masks from private sellers and none are like these. They are super comfortable and don’t slip below the nose when you talk. I can breath better in these than other masks and can’t even feel the ear loops. My six year old wears them and they stay up! Bought them to wear on an airplane trip and will wear them for everything now. Easy to keep hands off because they stay in place. Plus this was the only FDA approved KN95 on Amazon."
20-Mar-21,marionvgt,2,One,0,"I had a different brand of KN95 masks previously, so I am comparing with that other product. This Powecom product does not fit as snuggly, thereby causing me a bit of concern about the degree of protection from the Covid virus. It also has a scratchy feel against my face, particularly around the neck area. These cannot be returned, so I will wear them when going on short walks, etc. outside because I don't like wasting my hard-earned money."
1-Dec-20,V. Scott,4,,0,"Everything about the mask is good quality, and packaged well.  It is comfortable and fits my face as expected.  My only concern is the “punch marks” around the perimeter of the mask.  When the layers were press fitted, the machine made very deliberate holes around edge of the entire mask and nose bridge.  I could not find this mask on the CDC approved list, but it looks like it is covered by the FDA umbrella EUA for non-NIOSH masks.  I could not find anything regarding this specific model number.  Personally, I would not use this mask for protection against virus transmission.  But I will use it for dust, pollen, home renovation, and hobby activities.  It seems quite nice for those purposes."
1-Apr-21,Lorrykirk,2,,0,"Immediately tried on a mask when they arrived. First thing I noticed was how nicely the masks fit, maybe to tight but stayed away from my mouth. Did pull on the back of my ears. Felt like i was still wearing it even after I took the mask off, which wasn't a big deal but what bothered me was the smell inside the mask. Reminded me of a pine-sol scent. I resolved it by using a fan on the mask for a few minutes to air the mask out so to speak. Not recommending to do this but was the only way I was able to continue wearing the mask as I do like the style and design. I'm hesitant to give a good review because of the cons but they do filter as stated. Still..... would not purchase these again."
29-Aug-20,Randy,1,5,0,Poor quality. At least not for the price. Not recommended.
11-Sep-20,Not Actually Wonder Woman,1,3,1,This mask is not at all compatible to an N95 and doesn’t even provide as much protection as my three layer cloth mask. A waste of time and money.
10-Feb-21,Jessica McC,1,,1,I was so excited to get these fda approved masks with such good test results. Seems they are fakes.  I noticed they seemed super thin.  So I cut one and saw it only had 4 layers not 5!  It did how ever pass the burn test. It didn't flame up. Seemed good with the water test as well.  But I put the scratch off numbers in the website they provide to check for fraud and it seems the numbers were already used and indeed mine were fake.  I got the info about these being legit from a news station and did my homework on real kn95 masks. Of all my purchases it seems this is the first order of fakes. It's super important to do your homework on something like this.
12-Oct-20,Sfrank,4,2,0,"Of the KN95 masks I have tried, this is the only one that seal on my face. The others have a gap below my chin.  These seem to be of good quality, but because they are on the smaller side, the bridge of my nose gets a little tender by the end of the day and one of my ears were getting a littler tender from the straps around them.  But given one that is comfortable but doesn't seal because it is too large, or one that is slightly small and not as comfortable but seals well, I will take the latter."
21-Nov-20,Janice A. Linkowski,1,,1,"recieved as states.(needed to go to grocery) opened pkg  plucked first one out of  pkg,went to put on and low and behold the ear elastic broke,and believe it or not the second ear loop broke,thank goodness I have a glue gun to fix and repair,the great  chinese workmanship,so I might wear the said mask.teach me to buy the chinese JUNK,for first off I contaminated the mask by putting by fingers on the inside(if they were clean in the first place,being from china) and  using a glue gun.price  was fair,workmanship is missing,I am out the $$.CAN NOT RECOMMEND,would not recommend.they are just chinese JUNK.BEWARE,DON'T DO IT,regardless of what  they say"
20-Oct-20,Amazon Buyer,5,2,0,"These N95-type masks have much less leakage in or out than surgical masks, which can approach zero. Reading the details, the construction with the nonwoven barrier appears identical to ""medical"" N95 masks, at a much more reasonable price."
19-Oct-20,Debra M.,4,One,0,"These KN95 masks are a better fit (at least for me) than the previous brand I bought.  They fit to the face without any gaps.  My main problem is that my glasses don't fit well with this brand and keep sliding down.  Also, the ear loops are a little tight.  they are easier to breathe through than the N95s I still have that I use for grocery shopping. Overall, I am pleased with them and would buy them again."
11-Sep-20,S. Crawford,1,3,1,"These are far too flimsy to be an N95 mask.  Unfortunately, this is likely another Chinese scam."
23-Oct-20,K. Adams,3,One,0,"I just wore my first one today and have two observations. First, my glasses didn't fog. Yay. Second, it was scratchy about the face. I think wearing it all day, every day would definitely give me irritated skin. I am used to 3 layer cloth masks that are soft. I did feel safe with these. There was a good seal and the nose piece was strong. It was harder to breathe out of than my homemade cloth masks."
23-Dec-20,MN-engineer,4,,0,"There are two factors that make for a good filter mask:  the filter material has to be good and the fit or seal around your face needs to be good.  This mask indicates that it uses electret material (electrostatic charge) to improve efficiency without a lot of pressure drop.  This makes the mask comfortable but you can expect it to lose efficiency as the charge wears off after wearing all day (due to humidity).  The wire in the nosepiece wasn't firm enough for me to get a good fit so I used either extra wire or foam inserts like these to close the gap between my nose and cheeks. You may not need these. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Y7D5RX  My wife found that using an ear saver (strap on the back of her head) was the most comfortable for a good fit.  If your glasses easily fog up when using a mask, then the fit isn't good."
30-Nov-20,Bonny G Gazinski,5,,0,"This is my 2nd purchase of masks. This brand is soooooo much better fit than another brand. It feels really secure around edges of face & seals really well. We feel much more protected. We can breathe pretty good through it. It has a bendable flat ""wire""(?) on top of the nose that you can bend it to fit. Not a round wire which I find better. Put these on right out of the package & there was no nasty smell. I researched this model & mfgr, they are on the federally approved list for KN95. I like them so well, I have refered several friends. These are a great price point especially if you want to protect yourself."
2-Feb-21,jea,5,One,0,"I don't know why so many poor reviews.  Package i got was clean sealed,  excellent condition, had correct marks with blue-green printing.  Ear loops are perfect length,  didn't hurt ears at all,  gentle stretch loops, snug to keep on well but not at all tight. Perfect size,  not too large or small. And could breath alright with these.  :) Didn't fog my glasses either. Going to get another pack of these."
9-Oct-20,As I See It,5,One,0,"This product fits very well, easy to talk and breathe while wearing. Appears to be authentic item. Ordered this particular mask based on a third-party recommendation of KN95s that are on the FDA list. One discrepancy I noticed was that it's advertised on website as filter efficiency of 99.2%, but information that came with the masks says >95%, so it appears there could be some slight variation. Overall a good mask."
3-Feb-21,Heartwaves,1,One,0,"I ordered two packages of 10 each of these masks as the bigger package of another brand took longer to be delivered. I wanted to be protected with the KN95 masks ASAP. They arrived as promised, yet they were manufactured in a different country where people may have smaller heads or circumferences. They were super tight, severely bent our ears forward, and after a little moment, simply slipped off our faces. Not so good if you want to be protected in a pandemic. Talking while wearing the masks was not possible. I tried to stretch the strings, which made it a little better, but also ripped the strings off the mask even when being very careful. I wanted to return the items a couple of days after delivery, but that was not possible. Now I have masks that I cannot use and cannot return. I am sure the quality is great, the strings are just too short! If you buy these, make sure you are petite, have no beard, or better yet, only buy them for kids. If you are a normal caucasian adult, these are way to small and you cannot return them."
5-Mar-21,HRA,1,,0,"My first(and only) use of this mask was to accompany a friend to a doctor appointment.  I put on the mask and we went into the room.  As we were talking, I started coughing.  It felt like there was something in my throat.  I was desperate to get outside and take the mask off but we were in the middle of important discussions.  It kept getting worse and I was becoming congested.  When I finally got outside I quickly took the mask off and, within a few minutes, all symptoms disappeared. Amazon gave me a full refund so I have no issue with them.  We destroyed all 99 additional masks from this company."
28-Sep-20,Lily,4,One,0,"It felt so weird to have 2 stickers of anti-fake guarantee on the product, however, both of them are matched on the website that it is real, not fake. But some miscoloration of one of the antifake label bothers me if it is a fake antifake label (the numbers match, but the color doesn't). Also, this is not an authorized seller showed on powecom website. On the other hand, the packaging is exactly like it is shown on the website. So, I'm a but unsure here. Anyway, back to the product, it fits me very well. No air leaks out while I'm wearing, which is good. And it doesn't collapse when you breathe in. Overall, it is great when I wear it. But, I'm not 100% sure if this is authentic, real."
2-Dec-20,Mardi Gras Doubloon,1,One,1,"I purchased two 10pcs/bag piece Powecom kn95 protective masks. The masks appear to be genuine and unused but I have no way to verify. 1. There are places on the front and back of the bags the masks came which do not match the bags shown on the powecom site, in particular the front of the gag in the circle says ""N95 filter material"" instead of KN95, although the bag itself says KN95 protective mask. 2. The anti-fake sticker from powecom which other reviewers have described was not present on either bag. Also, the PASS CERTIFICATE which is supposed to be inside the bag with the product date and expiration was not present. I suspect the masks are either old or fake. Probably no worse than a cloth mask but I would not count on these for superior protection unless you can obtain a verifiable product. I did try on one of the masks. It fit ok. A bit small as others have described."
18-Nov-20,MJR,5,One,0,"To protect yourself from the fine particles in wildfire smoke or tiny virus particles in droplets, you must use the KN95 as instructed.  The first time I used one, I needed a couple minutes to really read the instructions and understand how the mask works. Since then, it takes less than five seconds.  Very comfortable, much safer, and worth the trouble to breathe cleaner filtered air."
26-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,1,3,1,"The package was opened, there was dirt inside, unsealed, missing one mask. These are non medical, cheap thin material. Waste of money"
6-Apr-21,Phil Bello,5,,0,"I was very insecure about purchasing grey-market masks needing maximum protection for myself and my elderly father with dementia.  I have several comorbidities and though I am far healthier than most people in my position; I am the only caregiver for my dad. I worry about what would happen to him if I got sick, but also bringing something in and infecting him. This manufacturer was listed on several government sites (NIH, CDC, etc) as a dependable source. Research on masks themselves informed me that Chinese K95 is safer than US KN95 standards. K95 has a facial seal/fit requirement KN95 does not. KN95 has valves that lower their effectiveness. The pack came with a scratch-off lot ID which you enter into the manufacturer's website to validate the product.  Took a little longer to arrive than ideal, but it's a global pandemic.  I was glad I could secure enough to get us through.  We're both fully vaccinated now and still have 3 to spare."
8-Dec-20,Chris White,5,,0,"As a regular person i have no way of knowing whether a mask is working or not. However, Sunday morning i was outside with a friend with a plain cloth mask on and they said ""What is that smell? It smells like a skunk!"" I immediately said I didn't smell anything. Then...I immediately thought that this mask must be doing something....lol. The fit is good (I am 6'2"").  The metal nosepiece strip is a tad bit too weak. I can shape it to my nose, but the ear loops are tight enough to pull it back slightly off my cheeks. It is what it is. I would buy them again, though, if that says anything."
5-Mar-21,Linda,5,One,0,"The fit for me was perfect, but may be a tight fit for some only regarding the band/ear straps.  The weight was very good and the seal on face was/is perfect. My eye glasses did NOT fog up with these masks. I would recommend for anyone having issue with eye wear fogging up when wearing masks this has not happened once with these masks to date. I use the mask once then discard so it would be better if cost was lower, but as far as the product I am extremely satisfied with my purchase."
19-Dec-20,Heather O.,5,One,0,"People say these are small which is partially true. They likely would not fit someone over 6 feet tall, however, for someone who is within the 5 feet range they will likely work. The masks are tight, to the point it does leave marks on my face. That being said, you want it to fit this way as it indicates a great seal. The masks feel secure, but they can tug on your ears causing some discomfort. The mask itself is soft and does not irritate my skin. I found it is best to open the mask, flatten the nosepiece entirely, put the mask on, and then bend the metal in the nosepiece to get my best fit. I love that I'm able to verify the authenticity of these by going to the company's website. They are included as part of the FDA's Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated with Administrative Changes or Respirator Model Removals: October 15, 2020.) as well. This mask helps me to feel safe while protecting others, and I have already purchased more."
24-Aug-20,Jennifer,5,3,0,These masks are authentic and comfortable. Fast shipping and you receive an email after ordering with instructions how to ensure the masks are authentic.  There is a tamper proof seal on the packaging and a unique code that you enter on a website.  Shipping was also super fast.  I will definitely be purchasing more when needed.
1-Dec-20,J Dub,5,,0,"One reviewer mentioned that he wouldn’t trust this mask. Well a BGR news article stated and I quote, “Among all the KN95 masks available on Amazon right now, only Powecom KN95 masks and AccuMed KN95 masks are included on the FDA’s “Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China.” It also stated, ..”In the case of Powecom KN95 masks, NIOSH found that they filter up to 99.4% of particles. Meanwhile, AccuMed KN95 masks were found to filter up to 98.2% of small particles.” I wear mine with confidence. Like anything strapped to your ears, they irritate after long use. But knowing that you have a proven protective mask on eases any inconvenience."
5-Oct-20,Anne Shepherd,1,3,0,These would be ok if they ear straps were longer. They make us look like Dumbo with ears being pulled out !!
21-Dec-20,R. Elliott,4,,0,"I checked the FDA site  under - Umbrella EUA for Non-NIOSH-Approved Disposable Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) Manufactured in China (Reissued October 15, 2020). To me that means these masks are ok but under 95 standards. How much is hard to say. I have a couple of 3M N95. The 3M masks are thicker by far. At any rate I checked if they were fake & they were not. They will do & should a step above cloth masks. The next few months, especially Dec, Jan, Feb,Mar will be the ultimate test. No matter what something is miles ahead of nothing. Be safe & good luck."
25-Nov-20,ATHA,3,One,1,"I am sorry but I am suspect of anything made in China.  In the past their cat food product killed many valuable family pets. The items I have bought made in China ALL have some flaw or inferior substance used to make the item.  Like jewelry made in China,  their metals are inferior and turn dark or green.  I'm boycotting items made in China to the best of my ability."
2-Dec-20,Post Punk Poppy,1,,1,"These are so brutally painful to wear that we didn't even consider donating them to anyone (plus, we're not convinced they're safe). I wore one for half an hour and was in unbearable pain behind the ears. They're not adjustable, are very small (and I have a narrow head with a small nose and mouth), have weird stitching, and poke out like cones in front. It will be a great day when we can firmly select for Made in the USA on Amazon -- not a guarantee, but better odds against receiving questionable and unregulated goods, and we would like to be able to employ our neighbors."
31-Aug-20,Maya Vera,5,2,0,"I am very happy with my masks. My package arrived faster than expected. It was impossible to find these masks anywhere else, and the price is great. Great customer service too. They reached out to me to see if I was satisfied. I will buy more masks from the same company."
17-Jan-21,J. Lee,1,5,1,"Item is possibly fake. No verification anti-fake sticker, construction of mask is different from authentic mask, no stamping of brand, mask info on outside."
17-Feb-21,Patrick T,1,2,1,These are FAKE Powecom masks that lack the red authenticity sticker/QR code on the back of the package near the barcode. Do NOT purchase! Google search “powecom authorized distributor” for more details.
24-Jan-21,dchulack,5,3,0,"These are the most comfortable face masks.  Being KN95 also more effective than paper thin ones.  The ""seal"" around nose is great, my glasses don't fog up like other masks."
1-Jan-21,3of2,1,3,0,"The package I received was not properly factory sealed.  Mine arrived partially open out of the shipping envelope, and it could have been easily opened/reclosed previously. As a result of the packaging not being factory sealed, I really can't trust they were free of secondary contamination. I sent mine right back--nothing I want to put on my face in a pandemic!"
26-Sep-20,pete,5,,0,"These masks are excellent. They fit snug to your face which is important to get good protection. They can be worn several times. ""As stated on the package."" As long as you are taking care of them and not mucking them up. I wear one then afterwords I  put in a zip lock bag and write the date on them. I then wait a week before wearing again so any virus dies and rotate them. After wearing a few times for running errands I then throw them away.The straps are very strong, the masks are thick offering excellent protection and easy to breath through. I get an excellent seal on them. They have a scratch off label on the back of package. You go on the website and punch in the numbers to verify if they are real masks from powcom company. I did try out the verification method and the masks I got were authentic and I have confidence in risky situations that these work. They were approved by the FDA to use under the emergency authorization list. My wife and son agree we like these the best out of all the ones we tried. Powcom is excellent quality."
14-Feb-21,Hashem Nassereddine,1,,1,"As a healthcare worker I take great care when it comes to catching COVID as I could potentially infect all my patients. Therefore, I have been wearing KN95s while outside of the hospital since April and I have never had any issues whatsoever. These masks are terrible in comparison to every other KN95 I have bought in the last year. The mask part is very small and barely covers the front of my chin when my mouth is closed. As soon as I open my mouth to breath or talk it no longer covers my mouth at all. Furthermore, the elastic bands for the ears are so tight this mask became painful in the few minutes I was trying it out. There is no way that I could wear this for 30 minutes let alone a whole day. If you are trying to stay safe and protected from COVID then definitely look elsewhere as these masks are absolutely useless."
29-Dec-20,F. Mifflin,5,2,0,"Like so many I was shopping for masks that offered better protection than the surgical types for when there is a bit more risk from a crowd.  These have the quality of another more expensive brand, but a lower price.  These fit snug, have just enough ear loop pressure without tiring the ears and not hard to breathe in.  In short these are a good deal for what I need."
6-Dec-20,John Karwoski,5,,0,"I wanted a mask that would protect me from others in addition to protecting them from me.  This mask seems to do well.  The cloth mask was heavier and I was not comfortable having it looped around my ears.  I wore the cloth mask with two loops around my head. This KN95 mask is light enough do its ear loops are fine for me.  I can feel the mask expanding and contracting as I breath, so I believe it is tight enough so I am actually breathing through the mask material, and not just through air gaps between the mask and my face."
31-Jan-21,Jane D.,1,4,1,I received fake masks. There was no anti-fake sticker. There is no writing on the mask. Please refer to the Powecom website to see how authentic masks should look.
15-Feb-21,Paulette,3,,0,"This was from the FDA approved website for KN95 masks. There was a seal on the bag that you scratch off and go to a website to confirm authenticity of the masks.  The only concern I have is when I hold it up to the light I can see there the seam like areas that are made from clear material and not sure how effective that is.  Overall, it is a great fit and is secure around the face as it should be.  If the manufacturer can confirm the seams I can see thru are 100% safe and provides protection then I would use them but not at this time."
9-Feb-21,Caiya D.,1,,1,"I bought these masks because this brand is, supposedly, on the CDC recommended list.  N95 & KN95. masks are suppose to consist of 5 layers, with at least a 94-95 percent filtration capability.  These masks have the consistency of 2 paper towels folded together & they don't snugly cover my face.  I have to use an additional, different (secure filter) brand mask over top of them!  A waste of money!  I do not recommend these masks.  Searching for authentic, secure, reliable KN95 masks (made in the USA), is like looking for a needle in a haystack & expensive!"
17-Jan-21,TC,2,4,0,These masks were too small for me to use.
23-Nov-20,Michael Guerrero,3,One,0,This is definitely an inferior product when compared to similar 3M products. I have an issue with the adjustable nose strip at the top of the mask. I cannot press it enough to have a close fitting fit. Most of the air I'm breathing with this mask is from the unfiltered air passing through these gaps. I would not purchase these again.
30-Sep-20,Daniel Maldonado,5,2,0,"I used this KN95 mask for my round trip flight from NYC to Detroit earlier this month. I touched down on September 15th. After a 14 day quarantine, I’m still Covid free. The mask is very comfortable. Adjust the nose piece to conform to your face, you will get a nice tight seal around your nose and mouth (the mask will inflate and deflate slightly as you breathe, which is the proof that the air is being pushed through the layers) Ignore the reviews who claim that there are holes in the mask...it is a transparent heat seal and there are no holes in this mask."
18-Nov-20,Joe,3,3,1,Not individually packaged which makes me question authenticity.
24-Dec-20,SRH,1,2,1,FAKES! I just got these opened pkg and Entered authentication number on powecom website for anti-fake check and the The item came back as having “already been authenticated two times before be aware of a fake”
4-Oct-20,Marti Morandi,5,One,0,I have been using a single KN95 mask for both the virus and for the wildfire ash that hung over our part of Oregon for a week.  Needless to say this mask is really holds together well.  I was delighted to find 10 masks for a very reasonable price.  The delivery was prompt and the company sends information that allows you to check that the masks are authentic as described.  I was so pleased with my purchase that I have ordered some for a friend of mine.
4-Oct-20,Joe,1,3,0,Very poor quality. Strings snapped almost immediately on two of them. Good enough if they stay on your face.
25-Nov-20,Bibon,2,3,0,"Fits well on my small mother in law, less comfortably on my wife, far too tight for me (4'10"" male). Rubbers are too tight for my face (it's probably suited for Chinese market)."
28-Jan-21,Typhooner,3,,0,"These seem to be a good quality mask... and I had no trouble confirming their authenticity... BUT they're definitely sized for someone smaller than an adult Anglo male.  Which means that the mask itself protrudes out in front of your chin/nose, rather than ""cupping"" over chin/nose.  It also means that the elastic ear straps pull really tight against your ears, pulling them forward and outward ala Barack Obama.  I'll be giving them (I bought 20) to my teenage daughter because they really ARE good quality, just more child-sized than what I need."
30-Jan-21,lao3d,1,,1,"Firstly, these masks are not NIOSH-certified, an important consideration. Secondly, they are quite small. I’m an adult male, and although I’m not a small person, I don’t believe I have an unusually large head. The ear loops are extremely tight and became painful even after only a few minutes of use. I can still feel the rawness a day after wearing. While a tight seal is important, there’s no reason for a mask to be painful to wear. Since mask-wearing is vital to combating the ongoing pandemic, we should avoid those that discourage their use."
28-Dec-20,MGT,5,One,0,"These are very good quality and conform very well to my face. I am not sure if they come in different sizes, but I have a pretty small face and these are perfect for me. They  are the real thing, not a copy.  This is not something I would wear just to go for a walk for that I use the surgical folded ones because they are more comfortable, but these make me feel much safer if I have to take an elevator or need to be indoors with other people."
30-Aug-20,Andrei Iogansen,1,7,0,Terrible. The inner surface is hairy. You will inhale long thin hairs. Do not buy.
4-Dec-20,mc,1,,0,"The ""cut"" of this mask looks like all the other ones out there.  I believe however, that the overall opening is a bit wider than my other KN95's and therefore does not create a decent seal around my face.  This mask definitiely feel a bit thicker than my other masks.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  The ear loops are shorter than all other masks I have worn.  This creates a bend in my ear and significant discomfort after a few minutes of wearing.  I am thin and have an oval-shaped face.  My husband's ears are so pulled that he cannot even wear this mask for a minute."
29-Jan-21,Kindle Customer,1,3,0,Item is too small and doesn't hook around the ears
1-Feb-21,Jbwash,1,2,1,Counterfeit- Not Powecom These are not the ones listed approved by FDA.  They do not carry the authentic seal and was very disappointing.  Not Powecom masks.  Do not buy.
31-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,1,3,1,"I have ordered Powecom KN95 masks before and these appear to be counterfeit. The bag was not tamper proof sealed and the masks had no markings at all on them unlike the picture  shown in the description. Fortunately, I was able to get a refund but will not be using these filters."
17-Aug-20,Andromb,5,3,0,"Whoever thought that buying KN95 masks would be so challenging! Fit, breathability, FDA, cost and other factors were of concern. However, these masks are perfectly fine - they fit much better than the standard surgical masks and are quite easy to breathe through."
20-Dec-20,Lisa Mowery,5,One,0,"I'm a retired ICU nurse, so experienced in N95 mask  use. This is much thinner than the 3M N95s but is easier to breathe through. It fit my medium sized face very well. The duckbill N95s never got a good seal on my face. My husband is an RT and he fit tested this mask on himself and it passed the Bitrix fit test very well. You'll be much safer wearing this mask than a pleated style. Be sure to press out the crease on the metal nose band, and push on it so it fits firmly on your nose and upper cheek bones. Also make sure it fits firmly around your face."
29-Sep-20,K L,5,2,0,"Good mask, good coverage. Follow instructions for wear. Place and shape to bridge of nose AND THEN loop onto ears. Tight seal. Doesn't fog my glasses. A+"
19-Aug-20,Harold S.,5,One,0,The masks arrived way before the estimated delivery.  The Vendor Innovate Tech sent a separate E-Mail on how to check the safety of the masks!  I never saw a vendor take such an interest in their product to reassure you about the use and safety of their product.  The Masks are GREAT!  I recommend them Highly!
30-Sep-20,Kayden5404,5,One,0,I work in a hospital in the IT dept. I have to round in inpatient areas and ambulatory clinics. This mask is comfortable and fits well over my face. No gaps on the sides or around the nose. When I am at my desk all day it stays in place while talking. Most importantly I can breathe comfortably. They are the right thickness. I feel safe wearing them.
8-Dec-20,K. Bartholomew,1,2,1,Awful product. Not stamped properly and may be a counterfeit mask. Fit was horrible- too small and I have a small woman’s face. Had to return because the quality was so poor
4-Mar-21,Who am i,1,,1,"I ordered this mask as I was familiar with Powercom brand, which if real would cost more.  I thought, well these are half the price, let's see.  #1 bag came opened #2 the odor was awful without even putting one on, #3 sent over to my experts in mask which both saw the holes in seams, more importantly after research as many others have said on this site, fakes.  Fit does not meet Powercom standard, other than fake packaging nothing notates Powercom.  Threw away immediately in a sealed bag."
13-Nov-20,Pat,5,2,0,Finally a mask that fits a petite adult. I noticed some comments that the mask was too small which gave me hope that it would be not have gaps - secure around my nose and not fog my glasses. I confirmed they were listed on the latest FDA Emergency Use Authorization List  and ordered. I'm back to order more because they do fit without any gaps and do not move whether I use the ear loops for a short time period or use an extension to secure behind my head for a longer periods.
30-Oct-20,Karen Rowley,4,One,0,"They hold away from your nose and mouth, making it easy to breath.  They are thicker than a surgical mask and I feel like they are better protection than a cloth mask.  If I go into a high risk area such as a doctor's office or Walmart, I wear two.  They are still comfortable and easy to breath.  I highly recommend"
14-Feb-21,Derith Macbride,1,2,1,"There is a security sticker on the back of this product which enables you to enter a code on the manufacturer’s website to determine if the product is authentic or counterfeit. My package, which looks perfect down to every detail, is counterfeit.  While I appreciate Amazon giving me a refund, and will continue shopping with Amazon, I think they should take this product off their website immediately. Their customers’ health is at risk!"
10-Feb-21,sondi,5,,0,"No, this mask is not meet the respirator assessment CDC list BUT it does meet the criteria on the CDC website of fitting snugly, has layers, covers the nose/mouth. So in short, this is not an N95 substitute but unless you are a healthcare worker don’t worry. Frankly, the N95s that are legitimately meeting the standards should be saved for essential workers in the healthcare field. You can review the assessment of this type of mask on the CDC/NIOSH website. All in all, this mask will be great if you wear it properly and are socially distant from others. In my unprofessional opinion, it’ll be better than a cloth mask and excellent to wear under a cloth mask."
21-Mar-21,Mazdafun,3,,0,"Even our daughter, who has a small face, found the earloops on this mask to be tight. I have a large head, so I find the earloops very tight. I'll use them for shorter periods of time, but I won't purchase this brand and model again due to how short the earloops are. This may work well for kids up to younger teens. You may also be able to use them with a strap that takes the pressure off the backs of your ears, but even they still exert pressure on the tops of your ears."
28-Feb-21,Giuseppe,5,One,0,"I am a 78 year old cancer patient taking a chemo drug daily with a couple other health issues requiring me to be extremely careful around other people during this challenging time of Covid-19.  I have always been very active, but have followed all the guidelines, including wearing a mask except when totally alone.  During the course of the past year, I have tried many different masks.  The Powercom KN95 is definitely the best one of them all.  I have confidence that I’m safe and potentially protecting others while wearing one.  It affords peace of mind that was missing with other masks.  And, the Powercom KN95 fits well, stays in place, plus is very comfortable to wear.  When my current supply is gone, I’ll absolutely buy more."
7-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,5,3,0,"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  When you receive this product you get instructions on how to verify that the product is the real deal. I misunderstood the directions. I texted the number provided. Within a few hours, I received a text back. The person asked questions, explained the process and stayed with me until I verified both packages. This is true customer service. I will use this company over and over again."
30-Dec-20,RH SF,1,2,1,Another person commented that there a holes in the mask.  There are.  They are just below the nose crimp.  I can feel the air coming in and out through them.  In my opinion a mask with holes will not offer you or others protection from COVID or at least as much as as one without holes - can I get a Duh?
14-Sep-20,rescue lady,5,,0,"These are very nice ,they come with a product authenticity guarantee  but I was happy to see the quality of the product. The mask is nice and thick while providing room between my face and mask to breath.  the elastic bands fit comfortably around my ears and the breathability of the fabric is perfect. With all the knock offs out there I’m very happy to get great masks  at great prices and to feel protected as well as comfortable wearing them I would definitely purchase again"
22-Aug-20,Age Old Dinosaur,5,One,0,We have masks that are adjustable with filter inserts for regular use (when we need one) but these were purchased for a time down the road if/when someone in the house becomes ill and top-of-the-line protection is needed.  Read up about KN95 masks and you'll realize why the FDA approval is vital.
21-Mar-21,Robert Solis Jr.,4,,0,"The mask itself is great.  Creates a tight seal on both mine and my wife’s face.  Way better than a homemade cloth mask.  The one significant issue is the elastic ear loops.  They are small and they pull on your ears.  For me, it was digging into my ears and causing a headache from the pain. My wife is petite and it bends her ears too and feels uncomfortable.  I have to use a loop extension piece otherwise I wouldn’t be able to wear it for more than a couple of minutes."
26-Jan-21,Maggie,5,,0,These are my favorite brand of the KN95’s so far! They’re comfortable and easy to breathe in. These also seal across the top of your nose properly. I’ve tried others that don’t seal properly and then my breath comes through the very top and fogs up my glasses so it’s nice I found a mask that seals properly so I don’t have to deal with that all day! I do recommend and I usually wear for one week then change out to another. (You could wear much longer than that though) I highly recommend!
3-Feb-21,A Reader,2,One,0,"I bought these for my whole family but they fit only the 10-year-old child.  On adults, the straps pull the ears forward and the mask leaves marks/indentations on the face after wearing for a short length of time.  They are perfect for kids, though, so I will use them for that purpose."
30-Jan-21,Mia Casole,5,One,0,"So, these for sure seem legit...I’ve added photos for certificate that came in package, along with directions for wearing. Of course, I don’t read Chinese, or know how to check, but at least this company is making a big effort to look legit."
28-Sep-20,LoveToShop,5,,0,"The mask is made of good quality.  The ear loop is made of good quality material and was melt into the mask.  So, the loop will not break easily.  Also, the form of the mask fits my face easily and I don't need to adjust the nose bridge all the time.  I feel that my face is 100% covered with no gaps.  This is definitely much better than those disposable non-KN95 mask.  Though this is more expensive than those non-KN95 masks, it's worth the money.  I had also tried to validate the authenticity of the product.  I inadvertently entered incorrect codes a few times and got ""No code found"" error. I like this product much more than the 3M N95 mask which staples the elastic band and the band needs to go over the head.  It's not as easy as this one to put on. I feel I'm getting a quality product to protect myself."
9-Aug-20,Nicole,2,6,1,The product arrived earlier than expected. Was satisfied with the comfort of the face mask and the flexibility of the band strings. The only problem was too small fit and not FDA Approved like stated.
12-Nov-20,Katherine,1,One,0,"I was really excited to use these but after wearing it for an hour, the bridge of my nose hurt. It was leaving a mark and I had to change masks. There was no way I'd be able to wear these for 8 hours at work. I'm so disappointed because I just started this pack and the return date has passed. What a waste."
16-Dec-20,DogFox,5,,0,"These are similar to other [cheaper] Chinese KN95 masks I have ordered that purport to meet GB2626-2006 standard, which I demand.  China and other Asian countries have done excellent to outstanding jobs in controlling Covid 19 infection among their populace, and this gives me confidence in using masks with which they have likely accomplished this. This particular brand seems somewhat softer where it contacts the face and therefore is more comfortable to wear."
26-Oct-20,Michael Salvatore,5,One,0,These are fda approved.checked thoroughly. Had checked thru several sources. Bought twice.dont pay attention to negative reviews.you are being told to buy an inferior product Iam very sceptical myself and checked these over a few days time. Very happy with this product.of course it's your decision. Thank you for checking review.please everyone wear mask!
28-Feb-21,Monique C.,5,One,0,I am adult female with a small head/face.  They adhere to my face giving me and others more protection.  They do not lie flat on my mouth due to their shape.  If you're not comfortable with the KN95 you can always double mask.  The KN95 is the Chinese version of our NIOSH N95.
16-Feb-21,lmc,1,2,1,"These masks are a scam, all that is stamped on them is KN95, not any of the lettering as shown in their picture which would therefore authenticate them."
28-Nov-20,joe,3,,0,"I was underwhelmed, by a lot. First glance they appeared to have holes in them, but closer examination revealed they are apparently manufactured with a ""heat sealing"" method that melts some of the filter material in order to bond seams and apparently multiple layers.  A bit disconcerting, not confidence inspiring. The elastic ear bands fit nicely, but the nose band is difficult to adjust, making for a poor seal, at least for me. I would not buy this mask again."
28-Feb-21,YT,5,One,0,"It’s got the authenticity sticker that checks out. QR code did not work but the company website did verify the code in the sticker.  It feels a little small and elastic felt a bit tight. But that’s how it’s supposed to work, it needs to be against your face so no air leaks"
16-Sep-20,D. L.,4,2,0,"Realize now with Covid 19 and wildfires N95 masks are needed, but prices are high for them. Only 10 masks. Masks are well fitted."
15-Feb-21,NTP Photo,5,,0,This is an important purchase for everyone these days so I did a lot of research on government recommended masks. My husband has to travel for work andI feel better knowing he is well protected. These masks feel light weight and breathable. They conform to my face shape for a good seal. The nose wire fits snugly on my prominent nose for a no fog eyeglass experience. It also has diagonal creases so you can fold it into a baggy for carrying in a purse or pocket.
15-Oct-20,valenciarunner,4,One,0,"What’s most important is kn95 is approved by fda as a substitute for n95 as masks for healthcare providers. Or at least that’s my understanding. So while other masks are cuter, it’s about mitigating risk first. My husband calls them duckbills. Oh well. This is what I wear."
11-Feb-21,Ann Skwarek,2,,0,"I bought these K95 masks because they were the only 2 approved by the FDA. According to the media, many of these K95 do not meet USA standards. These masks were soft, comfortable, snug fit, comfortable elastic bands. However, I could not keep them on for more than a few minutes. I don't know why but I had difficulty breathing through them when they were on. So I had to return them. I am disappointed cause I wanted a better mask than just the hospital medical masks. I'll resume wearing two of those for more protection as was recommended by the CDC."
14-Nov-20,pk schramm,2,One,0,The nose piece is very short. I used it twice and it was so sharp when bent it actually felt like it was scraping my fingers when I pinched it to hold it in place. I have a small head yet the ear loops were very tight. I do not recommend this particular brand.
10-Feb-21,BB,1,2,1,These masks are garbage. There are holes at the seams.  The masks are truly pointless. Don't waste your money.  Such a disappointment.
22-Jan-21,Harry R.,4,2,0,"My order on October 19, 2020 had the masks pictured in this review and were accompanied by an insert stating where the mask were manufactured.  The insert is pictured and it says Powecom is the manufacturer.  I would like to know if these masks are the ones certified by the government. I have place two additional orders for Powecom masks showing the ""POWECOM"" logo on the mask but neither have arrived."
29-Jan-21,CMW,1,2,1,"According to Powecom's website, there should be an anti-fake label to verify authenticity.  There was absolutely no label - I would not trust these without that verification process."
31-Jan-21,David,1,,0,"The mask seems to be of good quality. However, it's absolutely useless because earloops are very short. It caused terrible ear pain and discomfort after a few minutes of useage. I was on public transport and had to wear it for an hour having a very uncomfortable feeling before I managed to buy another disposable mask in a drugstore. I am very disappointed. The company definitely has to improve earloops if they want to keep their customers."
6-Mar-21,Jack,1,2,1,"Masks I received were fake, nothing printed on the mask, and no fraud sticker on the package. I put water in the mask and it started leaking after 10 minutes."
29-Sep-20,BGM,5,2,0,Worked out terrific for me yet my husband found it caused his glasses to fog up. Easy to breathe through. Great for those who don't wear glasses.
25-Dec-20,Jan Anderegg -Author of the Julu Series,5,One,0,"I work for 12-14 hours a day in a long term care facility.  These masks have been a godsend for me. Our work provides thin blue medical mask that are quickly soiled and damp. I began buying my own and have tried several different types. This is my favorite. I am able to wear each mask for a couple of days. So far, I have stayed Covid free even though I’ve been in close proximity with people who tested positive. These are a great deal."
26-Mar-21,stst,4,,0,Ear straps hurt after a while and the fit or construction is not as good as a true N95 mask. I have the humidity/moisture build up in my N95 masks when I wear them and the N95 head straps are much more comfortable than the ear straps on these. These seem to work fairly well as the mask draws tight to my face when inhaling but does not fit as tight on exhaling so I imagine more of my breath is escaping out the sides.
27-Jan-21,Jeremy W.,5,One,0,"My children and 84 year old grandmother (who is terminally ill) use these masks and they've been great. We keep masks on 100% of the time as soon as we exit our home, even for exercise. My trust in these masks went way up when I saw PM Merkel using them, and that should be enough confidence for anyone that a head of state trusts them; so should you."
3-Dec-20,parke cummins,1,2,1,"I have purchased Powecom KN95 masks on several occasions.  Three of my orders contained masks that were on the FDA EUA list. My last order was counterfeit.  It did not have the anti-fake label,  the symbols on the front were not the same as the website, and the packages were partially open.  In the photos, the first two are on the FDA EUA list.  The third and fourth photos are the counterfeit."
15-Feb-21,Gwen,1,One,1,"These masks were linked from a site that recommended them, but they seem like unsafe fakes. There were a lot of perforations that were covered with a thin, see-through layer of plastic; different than the pictures shown on the site. I would say buyer beware on this one."
29-Mar-21,Samimami,2,,0,"The elastic band to hold the mask behind the ears is very short so these mask are extremely uncomfortable. My husband and I, both have the same issue with the ears sticking out badly. We are a medium average people with average head sizes but these masks are sized for small heads if there is such a thing as size for masks. This is the second time I've purchased made in China masks and both times I have had the same issue."
25-Nov-20,Jim,1,One,1,These masks are small. Very tight and uncomfortable. The construction also doesn't seem nearly as good as other KN95's I've purchased. I was also unable to verify their authenticity and I see that they're on the CDC's counterfeit list.
9-Apr-21,PandaWatcher,3,One,0,For a smaller adult face these fit well and seem comfortable on the face. The big problem is the ear elastic. It is too short and therefore is very tight on the ears. After less than an hour it really hurts my ears. I would not buy these again.
19-Feb-21,Lys,5,,0,I read that these Powecom masks were the best alternative to a full N95 mask those decided to buy a pack.  Here is how to tell if the pack you received is real or counterfeit (see photo).  There is a little scratch-off sticker on each bag which reveals a number and you have to go to Powecom’s website and input the number.  The bag I received was the real thing. I haven’t used the masks yet but they fit well.
10-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,"The first thing that impressed me was that the elastic stays behind my right ear; that has never occurred w/ the 'surgical' varieties that I have purchased.  Secondly, the mask lies flat against my cheeks, again, different than the surgical masks despite my following the recommendations for having this occur.  Nose piece is effective and the mask easily and comfortably fits under my chin.  The price is reduced, so I'm contemplating another purchase."
19-Nov-20,YC,3,,0,"Overall seems like a decent KN95 mask, however, compared to the last type I purchased, the nose piece on this one is very sharp and uncomfortable.  It has very little padding between the metal and your face - feels like one thin layer of the fabric, so it isn't super comfortable if you are sensitive.  Not sure I would buy again for this reason.  They could have easily changed the design to put the metal on the outside or final outside layer of the fabric which would have alleviated this issue."
7-Oct-20,D Gawoski,1,4,0,These are very small.  Won’t fit an adult.  Child size.  Don’t waste your money on this mask.
23-Oct-20,Tim,1,2,0,Small size very tight on ears. Ear loop very small. Probably those masks fits asian faces with small noses
15-Jan-21,Sandy,5,2,0,I would say this is a perfect fit for me. I have a smaller face but the kids mask it’s way too small. Normal KN 95 mask would be very loose for me and would not fit the face well. This one has a little shorter ear loop making the mask fits so well.
19-Feb-21,Jim,1,2,1,Ordered Jan 2021 Appear to be counterfeit masks. Lacked anti-fake sticker described in reviews and had nothing printed on the masks. Package design also was different than that shown in listing. Returned for refund.
21-Nov-20,D. Morgan,5,One,0,"Nice heavy nose piece stitched into the mask so it won't pop off. You have to bend it into shape with your fingers, not just smash it down on your nose. Once you have your fit it seals well, much safer than the surgical masks I was wearing. Not as comfortable as a surgical mask, but I expected that. Changed to this mask to better protect myself from inconsiderate people ""Not"" wearing masks."
17-Mar-21,Laurence R.,3,,1,"The credentials of KN masks are a question.  These seemed fine, and the packaging looked genuine.  But it is recommended that one scans the QR code to check on items like these and on my package it was covered by a ""protective"" sticker which, when I tried to scratch it off, defaced the QR code so that it would not scan.  I'm not sure whether that is an innocent mistake or part of a deception.  It does seem like if you could fake a whole package labeling, one could also fake the QR code.  However, I would have greater confidence if I could see what that code contains. Hence my mediocre rating.  Otherwise to an untrained eye, they seem to be OK."
21-Jan-21,DF,1,3,0,Very tight. Beyond snug. Uncomfortable to wear. I am not a large person. Better for children.
27-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,5,One,0,"I want to disagree with reviewers that point out it has hole in it, therefore it can't filter.  I too was concerned when I opened the box and it looked like it was full of holes.  Upon looking closer, there are no holes, just heat pressed material that turns clear.  They are not holes and are in fact solid.  This mask is comfortable, keeps it shape and is easy to talk through.  I have to talk a lot for my job and wearing masks that fit snug against my face (like the fabric ones) irritate my lips, these do not and work very well from my experience."
4-Feb-21,Joe,5,One,0,"These are as good of KN95 as I have seen. However they are a bit smaller than others I've used, so they would be a better fit for smaller adults. The green print on them is a bit of an eyesore compared to other masks, but other than that they are great quality."
14-Feb-21,patrick j welsh,5,One,0,"OK - I agree with several other reviews - the scratch off verification is sketchy when applied to an easy open/reseal bag. But, the mask seems legit. It provides a good seal to my and my partner's face. the mask puffs up when you exhale as air is resisted going in and out - nothing escapes around the edges. What some have described as little holes are not ""holes"" but areas where the layers have been bonded. May not be N95 but feel way safer than a typical blue surgical mask that has open spaces all around the edges."
23-Nov-20,Harry,1,,1,"The on Amazon description is very misleading. It says, “Filter efficiency 99.2%.”  The packaging says in large letters “Particulate Filtration Efficiency 95%.  The description says Multi layer.  The product appears to be 2 layer.  Not false, but certainly misleading. Finally while you want a tight fit, the earloops are so short the pinch on some adults. Overall a very unsatisfactory product."
15-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,2,2,0,Kind of disappointed.  Just not at all comfortable does not fit correctly. I think I have an average size face. This is for a bigger face. Really not what I expected value comfort and fit worst mask I have worn in the past year
25-Feb-21,Chung T. Nieh,2,One,1,Those face masks were for dust or so but not for virus just as it said on their own web.  They were better than single use masks but  did not cover mouth very well. You could use it if you did not have choice. Not recemented.
13-Dec-20,plasticrevolver,5,,0,"Paid $20 for 10 masks.  It's worth the difference from those fanfold kind of masks available at department stores. Those cheaper ones seem to have so many gaps around your face, while this one is more snug to make sure air coming in and going out is through the various mask layers. Can be uncomfortable for longer periods of time (hours) depending on your beard's growth stage. (Clean shaven is most comfortable.) Stay safe, who knows what really works, just try, think of others."
16-Nov-20,A happy Amazonian,4,One,0,"which pull off when you take off the mask's ear rings. Other than that, this mask is great. I found the U.S. distributor of the this mask and just ordered the headband style of this KN95, which Amazon doesn't seem to stock. If they fit my face as well as these do, things should be great! (I assume Amazon wouldn't be happy if I listed the source of the headband style KN95's made by Powecom.)"
6-Dec-20,Blue'sCultureVulture,2,,1,"I am not entirely sure how this mask received such high efficacy numbers. It doesn't sit well on my face, I can feel the mask lifting and being vacuumed into my face as I breathe in and out. The air leaks from everywhere, and it gets in from everywhere. If the fit were more secure, maybe it would help with the efficacy, but as is no.  I don't think wearing this is any better than 3 or 4 layer fabric masks. Fogging does not go away even when you wear the glasses on top of the mask, the air leaks from the cheeks, too."
1-Dec-20,SandyC,5,,0,"Thank you for providing these quality KN95 face masks.  They fit my face very well, feel like a tight fit, are comfortable, last for many many many usages in my ""home"" life (I'm not working in a medical setting - Cousin in ER working in big city with COVID19 all day recommended these when I said I wanted masks on hand for home-life that brought better protection than cloth).  Thanks again"
30-Jan-21,Tasker,2,,1,The units I received look completely different than the ones shown in the ad. There is a large center seam ridge but most alarming is the the four rows of what appears to be HOLES.  I think the holes are actually sealed seams but if I saw someone wearing this mask I would assume they are openings. This feels like a bait and switch and my confidence in these masks are now low.
30-Dec-20,Jacquie Vranek,3,2,0,"These shipped quickly and the material itself feels like nice quality, however the mask itself is very small. It feels like a child’s size. The ear loops were fine, but it felt like the mask itself barely covers my nose and mouth - including side to side. I bought these to wear under my cloth masks at the grocery, and I can’t wear them, I feel less safe since I can’t get a good fit with these."
4-Feb-21,Big John,2,,1,"This mask has very small ear loops that would not allow the mask to be worn comfortably.  They are unusable for me and Amazon will not accept a return of unopened, sealed masks. Note:  I compared a mask from this order from a mask from a previous order.  The mask from this order had much shorter ear loops.  Given the concerns over counterfeit products with this brand, it does raise a concern."
31-Dec-20,antzrus,5,2,0,"I haven't gotten COVID yet so maybe it's working. Who knows? KN95's from China kinda' make U wonder, but what else can U find? They cover very well and are mildly uncomfortable over long periods of time (more than 30 minutes."
29-Jan-21,Raph555,1,One,1,"Fake mask, no branding like the product picture Certificate manufacture date is from May 2020. Impossible that we can buy mask that has been manufacturer 8 months ago at the peak of the crisis Mask sold by Amazon"
26-Oct-20,Amazon Customer,3,One,1,"I did not care for fact that the brand mane, model/serial number and ALL-CAPS ""MADE IN CHINA"" was all printed prominently on front,  nor did I care for the rather odd chemical aroma when the masks are donned.  I asked for a return authorization and the seller DID refund my full purchase price - thank you.  Masks should be all white on the visible side! Also, the odd smell is probably just from being sealed up in the plastic envelope, but it still was not something I wanted to be breathing in."
16-Feb-21,Robb Smith,1,One,1,"I had a bag of these masks sitting around for a few weeks before opening the bag.  The labelling on the bag clearly said 10 masks.  When I opened the bag there were exactly 2 masks inside.  I had to double check to make sure that there were not other masks stuck together, but no, just 2 masks.  Two very expensive masks.  Find another seller!"
4-Feb-21,Kindle Customer,3,,0,"They fit me ( a woman) just fine, but my husband (a thin man) cannot make the bands reach behind his ears. When he tries the ears are yanked forward and the bands fall off. I find them comfortable and am satisfied but have had to order from another company, in the hopes that “large size” includes the bands. The ratings are misleading. I think they are very good, but.....you should be warned"
6-Feb-21,Shane Glander,5,,0,"The main selling point for me was the fact that it had a nice green color to them and they definitely do have a green tint to the lettering and the nose adjuster, but more importantly it was comfortable it's breathable and the straps aren't too thin or too thick. My only complaint I've ever had with it was it gets a little itchy, but that might just be because I have a beard. Overall decent masks n breathable, definitely will restock with more."
9-Feb-21,Mom in Boston,3,One,1,"I bought these specifically because they have a code on them to check if they are genuine. However, it arrived with the plastic package already open, so even though the code is on the bag, I do not feel assured that the masks are the original, genuine masks.  They are very thick, and a little big, but otherwise seem like standard masks, just now without the reassurance of their quality."
11-Feb-21,Jerry H.,1,,0,"Product is loosely packaged in a plastic bag which has really nice sealing on the top as you can see in the pictures on their webpage, but what you don't see is that the bottom of the package is barely glued and opens extremely easily. Mine came completely opened, leaving a question on the sanitation of the masks. I would not buy again and only plan on using these if I am desperate."
2-Feb-21,Crockett,1,One,1,"They were a fake ass knockoff from a 3M KN N5 that my wife has to use at the hospital when she is seeing patiets. The ""Made in China"" did it for me right there. Bring back making products in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!!!!"
30-Jan-21,Nikki P,1,,1,"The most INSULTINGLY, DISGUSTINGLY, LOW-RENTLY, KNOCKOFFLY, FAKEST MASKS EVER. 100% false advertising. The adhesive had clearly been opened at some point, there is no seal on the bag, the masks are totally blank - no stamp, no embossing, nada. QUESTION: What's worse, A) people who refuse to wear masks, OR B) people who sell fradulent, bootleg, fake masks to people trying to do the right thing by wearing masks to protect their families and communities? ANSWER: B) people who sell fradulent, bootleg, fake masks to people trying to do the right thing by wearing masks to protect their families and communities. I  can stay away from people who don't wear masks. But this bootleg mask gives the illusion of safety, and it's just so deceptive and wrong. Do not buy. I am getting a refund."
29-Jan-21,Hypnotist Collector,4,,0,"As far as I can tell, these are legitimate and they fit. I did not have the messy packaging problems that so many reviewers have encountered; the package was sealed and clean. The verification code worked. I'll use mine in combination with my cloth mask made from one layer of 500-thread-count cotton and one layer of high-thread-count shirting and hope to stay safe. I agree the number of fakes out there is really disconcerting, I think Amazon needs to take some responsibility for managing and weeding out fakes before selling them."
21-Feb-21,MCR,5,,0,"This is my go-to mask. I literally keep one in my pocket all the time to throw it on when needed. Really good fit and nice seal when you pull the straps to equalize tension. Haven't got covid yet, so that's saying something. I'm a moderately large guy. But my wife can't get them to seal well so she double masks with these as the inner layer and a cotton mask outside."
8-Mar-21,Moo Moo,4,,0,"I found it to very secure around the face but the elastic around the ears (for me anyway) weren't long enough, they keep popping off my ears and dig into the skin. Not very comfortable but maybe its cuz my head is bigger than usual. LOL Otherwise they're a great alternative to the paper ones ""for sure!"" I still wear the paper ones over them cuz they keep popping off."
15-Oct-20,Shannon Rosenman,3,2,0,This is not for someone with a small face. It goes from one ear to other and all the way under my chin to my neck! No thanks
7-Sep-20,AS,4,3,0,"This mask is comfortable and fits nicely. I had a bit of a scare when I noticed that I could see through all of the pin holes around the nose bridge. It turns out that they have used a transparent lining there so it looks like holes but they are not open, whew! LOL"
15-Feb-21,Marcus Dunn,5,,0,"This is the first KN95 mask that I've worn and I love it. The protection is there and I feel confident that I'm not only protecting myself but protecting others by wearing it. They are designed with quality construction. I haven't cut the mask in half to count the plies, but it is thick and sturdy. Fits like a glove, and not too tight (never hurts the backs of my ears) while staying in place no matter how much I toss and turn my head. And lastly, I do think I can breathe a little bit better than with any other mask that I've worn. The way that it sits not pressed agains my mouth and nose really makes a big difference in my opinion. I was wearing the blue 3-ply disposables when I worked out at my local Planet Fitness, but with these I feel less strained for breath. So, as long as we have to wear them I want to be the most comfortable I possibly can. These will be my staple from now on."
23-Jan-21,Edward J. Rosario,1,One,0,Non-Medical. Non returnable. Stay away if you are a healthcare professional such as myself. Mask is probably no different than any other KN95. Don't waste your money like I just found out that I did.
7-Mar-21,reviewer from Calif,5,,0,"I bought these to use on a cross country airline trip I made for family reasons.  My flights were in January and February 2021 during the height of Covid infections and involved crowded airports and pretty full flights (one was 100% full).  So I was worried.  I kept this mask on and added a visor (and didn't take them off during the flight, even to eat or drink).  I remained Covid-free and verified that by testing negative for Covid after.  That's the endorsement.  It seems well made and it kept me safe.  They are a little on the smaller side but fit me well.  Of course they are supposed to be snug to be effective, but they might not be comfortable for a man with an extra large head."
3-Feb-21,E. C.,4,One,0,"I'm not sure if this is certified or not but it passed my own tests at home.  The holes seem to be covered with clear protection, and no water passed through when filled.  The candle did not flicker when I tried to blow it out while wearing the mask.  I'll probably still double mask in crowds."
8-Feb-21,M. Park,3,,0,"Happy to find these masks on the FDA emergency use approval list but they are so small!  Way too tight for my husband to use.  The ear straps are too short so if he tries to wear it, the masks leaves indentations on his face from being pulled so tight.  Besides that, they straps will probably pop off from the tension.  But they fit my 10 year old perfectly."
7-Feb-21,firefly,5,,0,"I have ordered KN95 masks form several different sellers.  This mask fits snug as it should, but the ear loops are thick and do not give very much so after several hours, my ears hurt.  The other masks have thinner smaller ear loops, but masks do not fit tightly as they should which is more concerning! It would be nice if the ear loops would be adjustable."
23-Nov-20,Tuggy,5,,0,The quality seems pretty high. The ear straps feel and fit great (and are molded into the fabric rather than having cheap-looking staples to hold them in place).  Also the nose strip is molded into the fabric rather than having an exposed strip.  Fit seems to be very good after nose strip is adjusted to the face.  Comfortable to wear (as far as masks go!).
18-Mar-21,Soojin,1,,1,"These masks once I opened them proved to be so tight that neither my husband or myself could bear to wear them.  When attempting to stretch them out, the straps s append off.  Do Not Order.  By the time I took them out of the package, it was too late to return them.  I am surprised that Amazon would be promoting such an inferior product, a total rip off!"
28-Jan-21,FarmGirl9,2,,1,"The ear loops on the masks I received are so short that my ears are bent painfully forward. I do not have a large face! No other mask has done that. I wear glasses and hearing aids, so these masks are either going back or being donated. I have to wonder, too, at the efficacy of the material where I can see light through the ""perforations"" along the sides."
13-Feb-21,BaaBee3,5,,0,"These Powercom KN95 Face Masks are the most comfortable masks I've tried.  Not only are they safe and lightweight, but they keep my glasses from fogging up.  A big plus!!  The nose clip keeps them secure, even through talking and moving about.  I bought two packages of these for my son, and another package for me.  At this price, they're irresistible!"
17-Mar-21,Kat,3,,0,"I have purchased N95’s and other 3M type masks for years for everything from protection from illness to construction projects, and now Covid.  NOT one other product has been as uncomfortable.  The ear elastics are so short that they pull my ears forward, make my glasses slip and are useless. I only recommend them for small faced persons or teens."
11-Feb-21,TooMuchStuff,4,,0,"These were on the FDA emergency use list (the pictures of the product and packaging o  the FDA site look like this package as well).  They seem pretty good... fit ok and have the info on the outside of the mask as indicated in the authorization info.  I saw another reviewer state these were on the ""not authorized"" list..?  Not sure what they are talking about..."
1-Mar-21,M. Kelly,2,,0,"I saw these recommended online, but the fit is not great. The nose piece doesn't seem to bend in a comfortable way and when I wear it under a cloth mask as recommended, it rubs on my cheeks and goes too close to my eyes. I don't like having to touch it and re-adjust while I'm out in public. There is also a very distinct smell that doesn't seem to fade even after I've had it out of the package and worn for a day. I wouldn't buy them again."
10-Apr-21,Doctorbear,1,,0,"(1) Price charged ($26) was OVER TWICE price now ($12.55).  Disgustingly obscene PRICE-GOUGING to exploit and take advantage of our fears. (2) Straps do not fit correctly, no matter how adjusted. (3) Horrible smell. (4) Not returnable so a complete waste of money."
6-Sep-20,Inspector Gadget,5,2,0,Great mask and comfortable.  Wore on 2 flights of five hours each. No foggy glasses and no “maskne”.  Was able to breath comfortably during one hour weightlifting workout. This is now my “go to” mask.
23-Nov-20,An Average Consumer,1,One,1,"I do not know if I can trust these masks for protection.  They are thin and have perforation (""holes"") across the mask and you can see through the perforation.  The mask I received does not look like the picture in the description.  I placed an orange Post-It note inside the mask and took a picture; the color shows through the ""holes""."
23-Dec-20,Nick Onufer,5,,0,"How well this mask works as opposed to an N95 I cannot be sure. Having worn 3M medical grade N95s this cannot compare. I doubt it would pass a fit test.  Howevever, for what it is it does fit well, is comfortable and breathable to be worn at work for 8 plus hours a day.  It probably  offers a slightly higher level of protection than a standard blue disposable mask.  It fits both my face (Average size male) and my wife's face quite well.  The ear loops feel tight but this is a good thing in my opinion as it holds the mask closer to your face.  My wife enjoys it as it does not fog her glasses like a standard disposable surgical style mask.  All in all, for a lower risk, lower crowd envirornment I think its a pretty good mask."
22-Aug-20,S.A.H.,5,One,0,Arrived earlier than expected.  Authentication (code) process was easy to complete.  Company is very responsive and good communication.  Happy to receive quality masks during these times.
20-Mar-21,Jen,2,One,0,A lot of these were broken or broke at the ear hooks.
8-Apr-21,Sylvester Osagbemi,1,,0,"Absolutely awful.  This mask does not stay on because the strap for the ear is too short.  It pulls on your ear and then pops off all of the time.  This is the worst mask that we’ve purchased.  Also, it does not come in a sealed package, which is weird.  Don’t waste your money."
26-Jul-20,Kayleigh Brandow,5,5,0,I love this mask I don’t feel safe with those blue ones that barley do anything but these I feel safe wearing love them so comfy too!😊
11-Feb-21,missd,3,One,0,"These masks are really small for my face and didn't fit my husband's face at all.  They are so small that the ear loops pulled my ears forward when worn, which is/was very uncomfortable."
2-Feb-21,Briggadoon,5,One,0,"Since it looked like some other users mentioned quality or other issues, it seems like results may vary. For what it's worth, I believe the masks that I ordered are the real deal. The manufacturer and verification code match up with what is on the FDA's EUA list. The masks that I received are high quality. They may be a bit small for some, but they fit me well enough, and are great for my wife who has an issue with most masks being too large."
13-Feb-21,DixieWrecked,5,,0,"A decent seeming mask with good amount of filtration. But I personally prefer the n95 style that has the straps around the back and head. The ear straps don't usually give me a good seal. But these seem to be quality masks, for this price, if the earloops fit your face better than  neck straps . A little on the small side of average I think."
18-Feb-21,Monica,5,,0,"I bought these masks for grocery trips or to use in other public places. The fit is great, nice and tight and they're easy to breathe through. The only downside is that the ear loops are a tad tight, so wearing them for more than an hour can be uncomfortable. But I reuse the same mask multiple times and the earloops have stretched a bit"
29-Jan-21,Mary H.,4,One,0,"The ear elastic on these is very short. We will be keeping them, as we feel like the mask quality is excellent. But we now need to order ear savers to be able to wear them. PITA for sure."
11-Oct-20,X. Chen,1,3,1,Did not pass the water test. Leaking immediately
12-Sep-20,Shopper,1,3,0,"Absolutely not breathable. Also, I have a narrow face and it's a tight fit"
9-Mar-21,Milly,5,,0,"I love the fit of these masks, and obviously they are a better filter than cloth masks, and warmer than I expected. After long hours of wearing the straps did hurt my ears, but a quick stretch of the straps helped a great deal. I have been paying much more for KN95's that fit so poorly that I won't buy them again, I will buy these instead."
10-Feb-21,Scott Hodges,3,,0,After about 15 minutes it starts to cause a little hurt behind the ears.  Stretched out the elastic a good bit and somewhat better.  Other than that OK.
15-Feb-21,Kendra Sommer,1,2,1,"The masks arrived promptly.  KN95 was not embossed on the mask, nor was anything else.  It makes me wonder if it's possibly a knock off.  However, I ordered these before and they were perfect.  Amazon refunded me promptly for this order when I brought it to their attention."
28-Nov-20,closetotheknives,5,,0,"With this mask, fear not, the wilds of even Wal-Mart. This is one of the most secure and well-made disposable masks I’ve used, and I’ve been wearing masks daily since late February. A little hard to breathe in at first, but you do get used to it. There is a good space between the mask and your mouth so talking is easier, albeit a little muffled. The straps are very comfortable and in my experience don’t wear harshly behind my ears like other masks I’ve used. These have the added benefit of being folded, so they also store easily if re-using a couple of times. Overall they are my favorite on the market, and I don’t really feel as safe in anything else."
31-Dec-20,5gary,5,2,0,We've tried 6 or 7 brands. This is one of our two favorites. They are comfortable and do not fray. The elastic straps are not too tight and they do not break off like many others.
12-Dec-20,Clayton,5,,0,"These masks fit very well, and are the most comfortable masks we have found so far. Hopefully, as a KN-95 masks, they are effective in preventing the spread of Covid 19 to the user as well as nearby people. Some studies have shown that masks from China do not always meet the standards they say they do, but hopefully these masks do."
12-Feb-21,David Kaplan,4,,0,Been ordering these masks for my kids because they are FDA cleared and other reviews have stated they are a tight fit which I needed for my kids. Lately the consistency in the specifications have been off. The earloop band's length and thickness has not been the same. The elastic loops are thinner and longer which makes them not fit my kids as well. Not sure why these differences are occurring and hope the consistency issues don't have to do with some of the fakes on the market.
28-Nov-20,Plkek,5,,0,"I bought these exclusively for airport useage during the pandemic.  Many people are not wearing their masks properly at airports - increasing the risk of exposure to the rest of the folks in the waiting area.  The masks were a little tight behind the ears so I couldnt wait to get out of the airport and throw them away.  Regardless, I wouldnt fly without one."
28-Jan-21,Helen Toledo,2,2,0,The actual mask was good but the elastic loops were so tight to the point my ears  hurt so bad. I think the loops were too short for an adult size. It’s like it’s made for kids size for the one I received. I would really like to receive a new one with longer loops that’s comfortable to my ears.
26-Sep-20,David Beers,1,2,1,these are full of holes dont buy
14-Dec-20,Wendy Purrington,2,One,0,"After two hours of wear, the bridge of my knows was red and sore."
20-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,4,,1,"This is a KN95 mask & not N95. KN95 masks are not approved in the US for use in place of N95 masks and the term 'FDA' in the title is misleading as NOISH certifies masks & not the FDA .. That said, it's a good mask as it blocks odors around you. It sits tight in the face, so glasses don't get foggy. If you're in the habit of wearing your mask around your neck, that won't be comfortable, so I suggest buying a chain like that used for eyeglasses. Some healthcare clinics provide KN95 masks to their staff, although might not be the same brand."
12-Sep-20,Anonymous in TX,5,One,0,Very good fit and comfortable. Love the fact they have a scratch off number on the package so that we can verify the product is genuine from manufacturer and not a fake.
1-Feb-21,Alyska,1,,1,"I received counterfeit masks, with no anti-fake sticker. Refer to the Powecom website (powecom.com) to see how authentic masks should look. Further, when using the FDA EUA list to check if a mask is listed, the *exact name* needs to match -- this listing quotes two different mask types (""KN95"" and ""KN95 (Earloop Style)"") to bolster its authenticity and filtration % claims, neither of which is accurate -- if not counterfeit, this would be the ""KN95 Protective Mask (Non-Medical,)"" which failed making the EUA list, because they're supposed to be 95% filtrative, and only tested at 93-94%. Details matter, especially in this context."
25-Feb-21,That Guy,5,One,0,Pretty good. Little tight but that’s what you want. I sometimes toss another cloth mask on top of this if I’m in a more risky situation during covid for added protection.
27-Aug-20,Amazon Customer,4,One,0,"Hope they are real ones and are safe. Don't know, but they are easy to wear and have thick layers across the middle. My husband and I always just""Say a prayer and Wear."""
6-Dec-20,Fearnofishbob,3,,0,All is well except the elastic for the ears.... extremely tight...could not wear more that about 30 minutes and they had to come off .....not sure how to remedy this but I don't think I will be able to wear them.. Other than that they are fine
20-Dec-20,Clara Contreras,3,,0,Although the thickness of the mask is excellent quality the length is very odd making it very uncomfortable on the ears. Another thing I didn’t like is the fact that the packing doesn’t seem to be protecting is just a simple resealed bag with all the mask together
16-Oct-20,JB,2,,0,Appear to have the correct material and fit fine.  But the odor from the mask is a bit nauseating.  Writing this as I sit on a plane that is delayed.  Should be OK if the odor doesn’t make me throw up in it.  Not sure how I feel about the big Made in China stamp on the front.
18-Dec-20,carylyn,5,One,0,"It came fast and it has a seal with a qr code for authenticity- interesting.  The masks did well in NIOSH testing. They fit very well, seal well and are easy to don and doff"
11-Feb-21,David Kerpash,1,,0,"As soon as I took the first masks out of the package, the strings detached from the mask itself. The mask looks to be well made, but you are paying for 10 masks when only 5 are actually usable, and that is iffy depending on whether the strings hold up. If you are wearing it under a fabric mask it might be ok."
14-Dec-20,Hannah B,4,One,0,The picture displayed is not the masks that I received in the mail. The ear loops are drastically shorter. I have purchased a mask extender in hopes to solve this issue.
28-Jan-21,Mr Hedypoo,1,,0,Awful mask! Very small! Extremely tight! Instant headache! I would not recommend buying these for adults! Funky smell
4-Dec-20,French lady,5,,0,"I have bought those masks several times. What I really like is that they fit my face very well, no gaps on the sides or chin (I am 5'5"") like I have had with other brands. Comfortable around the ears as well, I always take a couple of minutes to make sure the ear loops are nicely behind my ears before going anywhere."
14-Dec-20,Acejvs,5,,0,"The masks I received appear to be genuine. The verification code checks out and the company stamp is authentic. The mask itself is very comfortable to wear, is substantive, has a secure fit, and provides a solid filtering barrier. I’ll order these again. KN95 masks are worth the extra cost for the added protection."
22-Mar-21,RSG,5,,0,"This is my go to for multi state road trips. Fits securely and the ear loops are made of soft comfortable elastic. Stops limited to 20 minutes for gas, food and relief breaks combined so mask wearing only for brief periods during the 18 hour drive. I used one mask to get to our destination and one mask coming back."
25-Nov-20,RX,3,,1,"Bought this twice, once in August, and again in November. The masks I received in November are distinctly different masks from the batch I got in November--they look different and fit too tightly, bending my ears uncomfortably forward."
21-Dec-20,DeeMad17,5,,0,These fit snuggly and are comfortable. My 97 yo mother agreed the fit was comfortable on her skin and did not slip off her nose. No objectionable odor and breathing was not inhibited. One can stretch the soft elastic to improve fit on ears easily. I recommend these masks packaged in a group of 10 in a reclosable bag.
5-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,1,2,1,"What can I say? The photo shows it all. Of course code doesn't check, but who cares if security seal doesn't look real and can be easily resealed. Ordered a replacement, let's see what I get next time."
15-Feb-21,Sasha,3,,0,"Breathability is ok. not the best. Elastic strap is tight on large heads, not recommended, especially with glasses; ok on smaller heads."
30-Jan-21,Gils Garage,1,,1,"Came in a bag labeled headband, but were ear loops.  Looked nothing like the item shown on Amazon or the Powecon website but stamped Powecon with a KN95 melt brand on the mask.  Returned for Amazon gift refund. Sold and shipped by Amazon."
3-Mar-21,Rachel A,1,,0,"Can something be too small and too big at the same time?  My eyes, ears and cheek bones got scrunched, but the bottom part jutted into my neck. I don’t recommend."
22-Mar-21,med1pilot,3,,0,"Comfortable, but they don't seal very well.  No matter how I adjusted the metal nose piece or positioned it on my face, there was always some air leakage around the edges."
31-Jan-21,Janice Knight,1,,0,Definitely desent quality but very small and itchy material.
2-Apr-21,Emilie G.,2,,0,Doesn’t fit small or even medium faces. Cuts into the lower part of our eyes. I gave one to a male friend and he had the same issue
2-Dec-20,GVegasYeah,4,One,0,"Fits well, I have a small face. Fogs up glasses a little so not a super tight fit. Better than a surgical mask. Smells plasticity out of package. A little itchy, but not bad."
4-Jan-21,Carlos Gutierrez,5,2,0,I bought this mask because it is approved by the FDA and it gives me alot of confidence to know that it has been tested in the US.  You can copy and paste the following into Google for the test that deems this mask 99%+ effective by the CDC: “modified teb-apr-stp-0059 Guangzhou Powecom”.
25-Nov-20,robert,3,,0,don't fit adult its smaller than normal
5-Dec-20,Nicholas,3,,0,"Efficacy is fine - just elastic is too short, so prepare for Dumbo ears and lack of comfort.  So sending it back"
9-Feb-21,PFraser,5,,0,"The masks I received were sold by Innovate Tech LLC in Tempe, AZ. The bags did have the ""anti fake"" stickers on the back so I was able to verify they were genuine. They fit an average size man well. The elastic straps stretch very well and it has a reasonably tight seal. Delivery was much quicker than stated."
6-Feb-21,E. Yu,5,,0,"I have a fairly small face (not child size, but I'm petite) and this mask barely fits on my ears after stretching out the ear loops a bit. It pulls my ears forward a bit but stays and feels like it has a good seal. No way this fit my husband -- ended up buying him the Hotodeal KN95s which fit well."
13-Jan-21,knee,5,One,0,On the FDA and CDC lists as approved for use. Comes with certificate.  Many companies cheat on design. This co is great. Fast delivery and great svc.
15-Feb-21,George Kluney,1,2,1,This mask is dangerous because it is full of holes: it is manufactured with 44 rectangular holes measuring 1/8 by 1/16 inch.  The total area of all the holes is more than 1/2 x 1/2 inch.  Unbelievable!  Don't risk your health and life with this piece of junk from China.  Someone should go to jail.
19-Feb-21,RCM,5,,0,"I've worn one for a week now and am very pleased with it.  I know it fits tightly because it balloons outward slightly when I exhale and sucks in slightly when I inhale.  It is a bit harder to breath than with my cloth mask, but I believe it provides vastly more protection.  I plan to keep on wearing it."
3-Feb-21,Zoe,3,One,1,"Passed water test, failed fog test. No certification seal that could be checked, bottom of package opens easily without one. Was comfortable but smells slightly and turned my cheeks around the mask a rosy red color with some irritation. Would not buy again. I'm sensitive to chemicals and was not sure the ones I got are authentic."
31-Aug-20,Kirsten,5,One,0,Amazing customer service! Masks shipped quickly and arrived sooner than expected. I feel safe wearing these masks as I am a dental hygienist and need to wear an N95 all day. Mask fits so well and doesn’t have any lingering smells.
26-Nov-20,sunshineca,4,,0,Had some issues with the masks and emailed the seller. The seller provided prompt and courteous customer service to resolve the issues. Kudos to the seller. Customer service I would rate it 5 out of 5. Masks themselves not so much. Buyer might want to research to see if there is a FDA approved list.
2-Feb-21,Consumer,1,One,1,I’ve been duped. I ordered these four times before I realized they are counterfeit. Not as pictured. No company name or numbers. Just a generic KN95 stamp. So angry!
27-Nov-20,Animal Lady,5,,0,I like these masks a lot for the way they fit my face and the amount of resistance I get when breathing through them. They are tight enough not to fog my glasses. I wish their appearance was a little less stark and utilitarian - I wear another mask over them to make them look not quite so 'hospitalish'.  But excellent product overall.
30-Dec-20,H. Klashinsky,5,One,0,"We used these on a recent flight and it gave me added security during the pandemic. The fit was perfect for both my petite face and my husbands larger one. I did not have any trouble breathing, but did find they made my face warmer. It was a good trade off for the added security in a congested area."
7-Mar-21,A,5,,0,"I bought some of these when they started recommending doubling up on masks... I'd rather wear one lightweight, effective mask in crowded areas than a bunch of hot layers of cloth. I can tell it's making a decent seal around my face and chin by the way it collapses when I breathe.  I've also used them in smoke and construction dust and they're very effective for those purposes as well."
19-Feb-21,NeekyNeek,1,One,1,I appreciated the price but the masks are not legit. My boyfriend bought a couple packs and they had all the Powecom lettering and authenticity sticker on packaging. We bought another set and they were plain white no Powecom signage anywhere and no deal on the packaging. I should have looked at package before opening. Please read reviews; they help lol Will not be purchasing from this company again. Sucks
21-Nov-20,Dave Richardson,5,,0,"The masks are a good product & value -  I have just received them & they fit well , are comfortable in place & are well made- I think they will be good for the job of  air filtration in these difficult times, changing my mask often for maximum protection. Thanks- Dave Richardson"
25-Feb-21,Stargazer Cat,5,One,0,"Can someone tell me how you scratch off the coating on the anti fake label?  Nothing on mine scratches off to reveal.a number, so is it fake?"
8-Mar-21,Twinset,5,,0,"I like this mask very much. Very secure and fits well. Hard to use if exercising, but for normal use it's fine. Elastic around ears works well, sometimes area behind ears gets a bit sore if wearing for long periods of time. Definitely feel more secure in this mask than my fabric and lighter weight (blue and white) paper masks."
29-Dec-20,Mary,2,2,0,The package seal that these masks came in was open when I recieved them which is concerning. Seems like a route for contamination for a product that I hoped would keep me safe from covid :/ not really sure which masks are safe ro buy on amazon. Its challenging to find anything here that is cdc approved. I am not sure if i would recommend this product due to the packaging being open to contamination. Going to try to decontaminate in the oven.
21-Aug-20,Chris Ludwick,5,One,0,"I bought two packs of these to try out. They give you a verification code to check on a website to make sure they are legit. Which they were! As for the fit, super comfortable and nice and snug against your face. I will buy again!"
29-Jan-21,Mbeth,1,2,1,Masks I received are not as pictured here on Amazon and are in fact highly questionable for safety/protection!  Possible counterfeit?  Mask has perforated holes on face of mask with only a thin film covering-- I can see through them!  How is this protective?!
7-Nov-20,dcwuellner,5,One,0,Needed masks that would give us adequate protection from the virus.  They seem to be working well as we have not been infected thus far.
26-Dec-20,KC,3,,0,Feel more protected with these.  Well made.
3-Aug-20,Conquistador,5,3,0,These mask work well on narrow faces
4-Mar-21,Catie,4,,0,"These masks are small, but they are a PERFECT fit for me.  They DO fit tight, but, they are supposed to fit tight to keep all the bacteria/germs out!  It has the metal nose clip that is important.  I like that these are reusable.  I would buy these again, and would definitely recommend!"
24-Feb-21,Faye burtch,1,One,0,Fibers come off on your face and itches
6-Nov-20,70's teen,5,,0,"These fit snugly but comfortably to prevent air leakage on the sides.  They seem well-made and are easy to breathe in.  Forest fire smoke, pollen, and (hopefully) Covid are kept out.  It's the next best thing to a 3M N95 mask I've found and more comfortable to wear (esp. in hot weather)."
8-Mar-21,BostonBloomer,5,,0,Always have these on hand.  I go between surgical masks and these KN95 masks depending on where I am. Comfortable w no smell And these masks do not for up my glasses like surgical ones. Good value for money. Very light weight as my 85 yr old neighbors are always asking me for these masks.
13-Oct-20,Susan Goldstein,5,,0,Very happy with these masks.  They are comfortable and light.  TOTALLY like that they are on the FDA Appendix A EUA list.  Had some trouble with the shipping - I guess got lost or something but compan contacted me and offered money back or reship.  Glad I choose reship!  Got them today.
9-Feb-21,Andrea Vasquez,2,,0,"Firstly, I don't know if this mask is fake or not.  I also do not know if it's FDA approved or not- I had read that all FDA-approved masks are labeled as such, but I also don't know if that's true.  There is so much fake information out there, it makes me second-guess everything. I am giving it 2 stars only because they are not individually wrapped so once you open the bag, all of them can be easily contaminated."
21-Dec-20,Laura,5,,0,"This is a tight fitting mask with ear loops. It takes a bit more effort to breathe through than a cloth mask, but that is expected, as this is similar to a US N95 type respirator. I had to wear it for several hours, and it was reasonably comfortable and didn't need to be constantly adjusted. The ear loops did not bother my ears."
16-Feb-21,Amazon Purchaser,4,,0,Item is as advertised and was even evaluated by NIOSH.  These are KN95 masks so not exactly the same as certified N95s but a bit easier to wear.  The nose piece wasn't as comfortable as the one in my cloth masks so after a while I switched back to my homemade mask for longer wear.
27-Dec-20,tsabbe,5,One,0,I'm an adult male and this was too small for the face and didn't make the ears. It did fit my elementary school age nieces and nephews.
1-Feb-21,Fdavet,4,,0,"Very comfortable mask. It takes some work to get a leakproof fit, but it is possible. The best way to make it airtight is just to put another cheap disposable or cloth mask over it.  The pressure of the extra mask usually produces a good seal, and breathability is still good."
1-Dec-20,brittany g,2,One,0,"These masks feel very legit and I feel very safe wearing it, but it is so small on my face that it is extremely uncomfortable. I am a thin woman with a thin face, but I feel as if I'm going to pass out while wearing this mask because it is so small and tight on my face. Disappointed because it's great quality. My dad and boyfriend cannot even get these on their face."
23-Nov-20,Kevin Deegan,5,,0,"My 2017 MacBook Pro laptop keyboard began having problems due to the butterfly clips installed that year which caused several keys to fall off and become inoperable This thin mini external keyboard was the perfect short term solve as I was able to place it right on top of my broken keyboard and continue using the laptop it until I had a chance to get the MacBook Pro keyboard replaced at the Apple Store The keyboard was affordably priced, arrived very quickly and did exactly what I needed it to I’ll continue to keep this and the mouse in my laptop bag for future use"
29-Jan-21,Miss V.,5,,0,Fit perfect and the nose wire actually works!  They’re not thin or flimsy.  I do believe they might be a bit small for people with larger facial structure.  My facial structure is probably average/smaller and the mask fit snug but KN95/N95’s are designed to fit that way.  Just sayin...hope that helps.
29-Dec-20,Aveejeet S.,1,2,1,"I ordered these masks in Nov as they looked genuine and had good rating.  Upon receiving - outer package looked good as shown in pictures. Masks didn't had any  the one posted in Product description.  Nose wire was still green  so gave them some slack, as manufacturing may have been cutting some corners short. After wearing , i could feel that these are totally fake and cheap.  Smell and water test both failed."
15-Jan-21,Tom,5,One,0,"IF you gotta wear one, this is kind you want.  You can actually talk and breath without sucking the material down your throat.  N95 guaranteed too!"
30-Nov-20,Kindle Customer,1,,0,It seems to be one layer of cheap material. It has holes in it that serve no purpose. And you can get close to a mirror and breathe and the mirror fogs up which tells me it's letting plenty of water vapor pass through. I suggest you steer clear of these masks. I doubt seriously they offer any real protection from the pandemic. There are far better choices.
28-Jan-21,JaniceC,4,,0,The masks seems good quality. They are thicker than other non FDA approved ones. It’s also a tight fit on me (I’m 5ft8). The masks tend to slide upward a bit on me but I’m wearing glasses so it’s not too much a issue. Over good I think they are reasonable priced good quality kn95 masks.
12-Sep-20,Amazon Customer Daisy Turtle.,5,One,0,Bought these masks for my husband. He says they have a good metal nose piece making it easy to get a snug fit. I have a smaller face and these don't work for me
2-Feb-21,Portly,4,,0,"I got these recently from Innovate, fast shipping and they check out authentic on Powecoms website. They are tight on the ears. Might be uncomfortable after a period of time, I’ll see. I haven’t yet worn them out of the house. It’s hard to know what to buy these days but we have to have them. Wear a mask!"
6-Feb-21,Jessica,3,,0,"The fit and huggability are actually really good. Especially if you have a rounder face. I'm not sure if these are authentic because they have no markings like the one in the picture and they don't even say powecom on the mask. It also didn't have a sticker on the package authenticate them via their website. I ordered the item pictured, that's what I want to receive. If it's different, then it should be advertised as such. I'm not 100% sure that I received the approved ones..."
28-Sep-20,Rugen,5,,0,"My only complaint is that the strip that is supposed to conform to the shape of your nose is creased (due to being folded flat for shipping), making it difficult to get a good fit across the bridge of my nose. Otherwise, the elastic loops have just enough stretch to pull the mask tight to my face without folding my ears. Breathing through it is the same as with other KN95 masks."
20-Feb-21,Jim,5,,0,"Always hard to know in the current climate, but these are purported to be listed in emergency authorization. Fits nicely - a bit tight on the ears, but I only use them for short periods of time. May not be ideal for situations where you wear it for several hours."
6-Mar-21,Gadget Guy 123,5,,0,"The tented shape takes the mask away from your face, for more comfort and clearer speech. These also follow the contours of my face without gapping. Mucy happier! Now my mask of choice. Nicely package in a reclosable bag. Had one strap failure but none since."
28-Feb-21,Annette Kershner,3,One,0,I am a small woman but these are very tight.
4-Oct-20,Newbie,5,One,0,This product came with an authorization number you can key in to see if it is truly meets the FDA regulations.
29-Sep-20,Bob S.,4,,0,"I like these, they seem to have sufficient layers of filter material, can be worn for 8h, and I get a few days of use from them. Dinged one star because I thought the price I paid was too high. Prices on similar items are coming down in the last few months."
1-Mar-21,Linda,5,One,0,"Roomy, light weight and maintains its shape even after a few hours’ wearing. Shipped immediately. According to research, it is the safest and most effective mask to wear."
27-Nov-20,Dee,5,,0,"I like these masks. They are a good price, very functional, comparable to N95 masks. If they are too large you can tie a knot in the ear loop. It helps them fit much better. Rolling Stone just had an article about 5 best masks, this was one of the recommended and was on sale."
4-Dec-20,Enduro_Dad,4,,0,"I've tried a few different brands and this one is my fav. The problem with other KN95's is the short straps. This one is accommodates longer faces better. Nowhere near as thick as a 3m N95, but of course we can't get those still, 8 months later!"
23-Dec-20,Xavier Falckenheiner,5,One,0,"Great quality mask. Well made and feels authentic/safe. The ear loops are small though and the mask presses against the face. I would not say it’s the most comfortable, but I use them for 8 hour shifts without a problem. Good price too. Maybe don’t get if you have sensitive ears."
18-Feb-21,David Mendels,1,One,1,"I may be wrong, but it seems that these are counterfeit.  The bag they came in was not properly sealed and none of the masks have Powecom or anything else printed on them.  I have bought Powecom masks elsewhere and they ALWAYS had the name and information printed on them."
18-Feb-21,Judy B,2,,1,"I watched ABC News and they said without the NIOSH stamp, and the straps....,are an indication that these are not kn95 compliant...it is very true.. There is No stamp from NIOSH....Im pissed. So I gave one star for value because I can't trust them."
30-Mar-21,Mike8765,5,,0,"I’m a bit below average size for an American male, with a hat size to match. I also have a fairly thin face. This mask fits me well, but you would need a mask extender if you were bigger. And it would be too small if you had a wide face. It’s comfortable and lightweight, but what I like the most about it is that it fits quite well, sucking into my face when I breathe in."
12-Apr-21,Donnad,5,,0,I am so glad I tried these KN95s. I checked the FDA list of approved masks to be sure these were on it.  I prefer these over all others.  I feel like I can breathe and not being smothered.  This type of mask is the only one I will use going forward
3-Mar-21,Frugalgene,4,,0,"A good mask that is more protective for the wearer than the typical cloth mask. I could get a reasonably tight fit. When I breathe in I seem to be pulling air through the mask, and not around the sides. It took so long to ship that I'd forget I'd ordered them."
13-Sep-20,Kirk Lambert,4,,0,"Good material, and it has a nose clip. If the ear pieces were adjustable, I'd give it 5 stars. As it is, I can't get a tight fit. Works well with a cloth mask and PM2.5 PM filter over it to hold it in place. Due to wildfire smoke, the AQI here is over 400, and that combination works almost as well for wood smoke as my P95 paint respirator."
17-Aug-20,noel rauch,5,2,0,Family with medical appointments needed KN95 mask. I found them on line and they were delivered quickly. The price was good too.
7-Feb-21,John p,5,,0,Miss spent very tightly but are definitely better for a smaller rounder face. When I wear them they are extremely tight and pull on my ears so I wouldn't be able to wear them for an extended period of time.  They fit my wife perfectly.
15-Feb-21,Linda T,1,,1,"Check out pictures other customers have uploaded. Wish I had done that before I ordered them. These masks have holes in them - by design! If you hold a mask up to the light, you can see the light. Of course these masks won't stop the virus from entering your nose or mouth! I did wear one anyway as I walked the dog yesterday; I passed someone who was smoking, and I could smell the smoke clearly. That was just more validation that the mask is useless. Don't buy it."
6-Apr-21,bluemoon_wulf,4,,0,"The material does feel thicker than other disposable filters. The fit on my face felt pretty solid. Snug and comfortable enough. I just wish the noseclip was good enough to prevent air leaking upward.  For me, at least, that feature has been a hopeless search. Otherwise I feel these are definitely better than typical cloth or disposable blue masks"
31-Mar-21,Matt & Whitney,4,,0,These masks have been great during the pandemic. Love that I can scratch off the little sticker to authentic them so I know I'm not getting a counterfeit product. Only downside is they can sometimes be a bit tight and tug on my ears. Still highly recommend since it's still difficult to get n95s
8-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,5,One,0,"These masks look awesome and they are authentic as verified by the unique code provided on the label of the package.  I have received the shipment much earlier than expected. Also, the seller does care about his/her customer and wants to make sure that you are happy with the product. I was contacted by the seller who wanted to make sure that there was no issue with the product. That's great customer's satisfaction! I am very happy with the product and the customer service. I recommend this product based on my few days of using it."
22-Feb-21,Eric,5,,0,"These masks are great. Exactly what I expected. The large size that I order fits my face shape perfectly, and doesn’t move around when I speak. The ear loops are kinda tight, but not the worst problem. Thick construction and durable.  Would order these again."
17-Oct-20,biggie,4,,0,"I really liked these masks. Very good and passed the tests that are recommended for good kn95 mask. Those tests are holding water (without leaking), and not being able to blow out lighter less than foot away.  Comfortable and covers face really well."
1-Sep-20,Elaine P.,5,,0,"Very happy with this product as it is on the FDA approved list of KN95 masks.  I had a doctors appointment and this mask allowed me to feel safe going to the office.  I was even able to verify on the manufacturers website that it was authentic, Innovate Tech even followed up with an email to help us figure out how to verify.  Great service!"
29-Jan-21,Sue Smith,1,One,1,These are garbage! They don't provide you protect for anything because theres a line of holes by the nose and more a long the bottom by mouth. You can breathe great using them because of all the holes which gives you ZERO protection!!! Waste of my money and I wish Amazon would remove these from their site!
8-Mar-21,Sandy,1,,1,"Do not buy these masks from Amazon.  The seller is not a reliable source.  When I scanned the verification code on the package into the site it came up as not verifiable.  I then bought the same masks from a different site after doing some research, (not Amazon) and was able to verify the product.  The New York Times has a good article about where to buy reliable masks and does NOT recommend that you buy these from Amazon."
5-Nov-20,librarian,5,,0,"These masks fit in a comfortable safe way.  They do not slip off the nose, because the nose piece can be shaped for your own particular wonderful nose!!  I feel very protected against COVID-19 when I wear these.  Thanks to my son for telling me about these.  He is also pleased!"
26-Sep-20,mslibbyo,4,,0,I bought the masks for using when go to stores for added Covid 19 protection.  They are better made than the other KN95 masks I purchased.  I like the thicker material that the ear bands are made of.  It may or may not meet the N95 standard but I think that is gives better protection than a cloth or surgical mask.
30-Oct-20,Ben,2,,0,I don't like this mask .
20-Dec-20,Amazonian,1,One,1,Could not verify if this was a genuine powecom product. There was no scratch off sticker to verify. Can only presume counterfeit without this verification.
28-Sep-20,Steve,5,,0,Just what I was looking for. They fit snug they’re comfortable the wire at the nose is very strong and fits well.I was glad to find these KN 95 masks as I have purchased others that did not fit very well or had chemical smells in them.
8-Feb-21,Jay Davis,1,One,1,The product that was sent to me was inferior. It is not FDA approved!!!! Do not buy this ripoff. And masks are non-returnable! It is also not in the same packaging as is shown.
1-Jan-21,K. Marsh,5,One,0,I checked the FDA website and found these masks on a list of products given an EUA. That sealed it for me.
29-Jan-21,Inbal Mizrahi,5,One,0,These fit my face perfectly and create the perfect seal to wear underneath my cloth mask. I definitely will purchase more!
30-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,5,One,0,This is five layers and is comfortable to wear. Good fit. I looked up in Government site to see if this manufacturer was approved and they were. There is a scratch verification sticker on the product to check to see if it’s authentic. There is another product advertised that is only 4 layers and looks like a counterfeit so be careful.
4-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,"Very happy with the mask. It fits well over my face and forms an excellent seal. Even if they're not N95 standard, they at least have a great seal, better than any cloth or surgical mask. I just pull on the ear loops for a minute or two to stretch them out; they were definitely top tight for me out of the package. Was fine after I stretched the loops."
9-Feb-21,Margot,5,,0,"These are genuine KN95 masks. When I first got these, I was concerned, and posted a question about the little transparent windows which I thought were a type of hole. They are not holes, they are seams. These masks are great. They are on the FDA and the CDC list for KN95’s and are approved for Emergency Use Authorization in the USA. I am very pleased with them."
30-Jan-21,DanP,5,,0,I'm not an expert but feel these K95 masks are a step up from the blue cloth surgical masks and a step down from the N95's. Fit my 5'3 110 lb wife perfectly.  I find them a little small but still OK for me 5'11 200 lb
17-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,4,,0,Masks seem to be same quality as prior batches however these seem to be smaller. Barely go from my nose to just under my chin and the ear loops are small/tighter. I used a paperclip to hook behind my head so my ears don't hurt. Maybe you guys need to mark these youth or Lady size.
28-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,4,,0,"If you want a head band then buy some 7"" or 8"" long rubber bands. Tie an end at each ear loop. One end of rubber band can be tied over itself. The other end can be secured with 1/2"" length of electrical tape. Works like a charm."
1-Mar-21,Amazon Customer,5,One,0,"I’m very glad to be able to order true KN95 masks at a reasonable price.  These appear to me to be the real thing, and they are far more comfortable than what N95s I can get my hands on right now."
3-Feb-21,David Ulrich,5,,0,"So good I logged onto my app on the airplane wifi to review it. I thought my surgical mask was the most comfortable option, but this is no less comfy and it protects me much more than the surgical ones. This was a decent price, too. I bought these just for my travels, but I will probably wear these everywhere instead when I get home. Don’t hesitate to order, easy to breathe and the shape keeps it off your mouth/nose so I hardly notice it."
16-Dec-20,Robin Earnest,5,One,0,I loved the comfort of this mask and how you can still talk and breathe easily through it.  The assisted living where my mother is ordered some for the entire staff and residents. Will be ordering again.
20-Feb-21,Wendy,4,,0,"No matter what I do, my safety glasses fog up.  I wish the I could shape the nose wire better.  Easy to adjust the ear loops. I have a very small face and prominent nose.  Excellent quality mask....just not the perfect fit for me."
25-Oct-20,Jared M Jeffries,3,,1,"The authenticity code came back as already having been checked. So, despite the packaging looking authentic, these actual product inside? Who knows. They seem a bit thin compared to my genuine American N95 masks. But I don't have prior experience with KN95 so I can't say for sure. The real problem here is China's complete indifference to manufacture of fake products and Amazon's complete indifference to selling fake products. That greed is probably costing us lives now."
5-Nov-20,Rook Avagi,5,One,0,"As a Nurse, I have to buy my own PPE when the supplies are low. I used this mask for a fit test, which measures if a person can smell a pungent odor as the tester places a light weight but cavernous hood over you. I did not smell it. A great mask for N95 use!"
14-Jan-21,Karen Shea,5,,0,These are very good quality and I feel safer wearing these than regular masks — they actually give you a little more room to breathe inside! They also fit snugly around your nose so your glasses don’t steam up as much.
18-Dec-20,2MilFlyer,4,One,0,"The quality seems quite good. Good fit and finish. They just are pretty small, so if you have a larger face, these are not for you."
17-Feb-21,Laforgue Dominique,1,2,1,Security code is not matching!. Mask packaging was opened!. Impossible to send it back!. Worst fake item ever seen
22-Feb-21,Elizabeth Collins,1,One,1,"Read the NYT article on how to spot fakes and sure enough this one is fake...Has a Powecom fake QR code to varify authenticity but lacks the ""How to verify genuine powecom mask with anti-fake label"" instructions - I verified actual Powecom masks bought on another website and checked the one I bought on Amazon and sure enough the Amazon one is a fake!  Beware."
12-Feb-21,craftygirl,1,,1,My masks had a similar liter package but no printed lettering on each mask. There was no verification sticker so I assume these are fakes. I wasn’t aware that Amazon doesn’t accept returns on this product so I’ll just eat that cost.
29-Nov-20,Margaret,4,,0,"Comfortable, fits well no, problems with it ...yet.  I've only worn it a few times. However immediately when I first wore it I could breathe so much better than with other masks. That's a HUGE plus for me. So far so good, but I f don't know for sure yet."
21-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,1,One,1,"The good: The face mask is comfortable to wear. The bad: Not sure this product actually provides KN 95 protection. There is no anti-Counterfeit label on the bags. The masks are thinner, especially the middle layer, comparing it to the original product from China. We will not take the risk to return. Throwed away $40."
6-Feb-21,michael L,5,,0,These were made in China and are supposedly N95's but there is no documentation that this is the case. They could be just a cheap mask that doesn't really filter well. If the manufacturers want trust they need to have info that backs up the product
12-Sep-20,seriously sandi,5,One,0,Absolutely love these masks! First time I ever bought a mask that actually fit behind my ears comfortably! Most of the others just didn’t fit well...I had no issues with verification whatsoever! I am very happy with this purchase!!!
17-Feb-21,Kathy Now,5,,0,I’ve tried several types of masks. And now that the cdc is recommending double masks I decided to try these. I am very satisfied because they don’t fog my glasses and fit my face well. I’m a small adult female
7-Nov-20,Sagacitrist,5,,0,"Really glad I got these. They allow me to breathe inside of the mask which is what a lot of masks don't do well. This is comfortable,  doesn't scratch  or irritate the skin.  I will be stocking up on these for winter."
5-Feb-21,Daisy,5,,0,These masks are great and they stay put around the ears. I wear glasses and so many masks just fall off because the elastic cords around the ears are too thick. These stay put and my glasses don’t fog up.
8-Feb-21,I.R. Human,1,,0,"The ear straps on this mask are not adjustable and are way too tight. I know KN 95 masks are supposed to fit tightly, but these ear straps are so small they yank your ears so hard and so far forward you'll be looking like Alfred E. Newman in no time. Really uncomfortable!"
16-Feb-21,Lorena Arias,1,One,1,I received fakes...unable to verify anti fake numbers. Do not buy!!
29-Mar-21,Monica O.,1,,1,"I have an average size women's head, but these are so painfully tight & pull my ears forward so they're completely folded in on themselves, PLUS I can feel my breath coming through the little holes in it."
22-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,4,,0,"I have COPD and can hardly breathe when I wear these masks I can wear them for a short time only. It's not the manufacturer's fault, as I'm sure people with healthy lungs won't have a problem with these."
3-Feb-21,BH,4,,0,"Thick, fits well, but companies need to start making masks with head straps not ear straps. The elastic hurts my ears. One of the thicker, safer masks. I'm a petite female with a slim face, a larger person might find this even more uncomfortable. Hit and miss whether or not it steams my glasses, no idea what I'm doing right when it doesn't!"
7-Feb-21,Kindle Customer,5,,0,"Great product!  This is my second order. But, with this order, my bag was open with masks falling loose from the inner bag.  Just a heads up, that the product bag needs extra tape to contain the masks."
27-Oct-20,steve,2,,0,Item came loosely sealed and has no anti-fake scratch off sticker or any codes to verify the authenticity of these masks as many indicated (only reason to pay a higher price for it).  Will be returning.
8-Mar-21,RPoteet,2,,0,"Well I am not really happy with these. I bought them because they were described to be regular sized to fit mist. They are super small. The ear peices are to small and break. I normally wear small/regular N95 masks as a nurse but these are not that. I knew they were KN95 which is fine and I would say that they filter well and these would be great for a child, but not adult. Disappointed because I can not use them. I did not return them because I just gave them to my granddaughter and they fit her fine."
10-Feb-21,InkaS,4,,0,Great mask with limitations. The mask seems to be of good quality but the straps for the ear are way too short for a regular adult head. Perhaps it works better for kids. I had to use a behind the ear extension and works fine .
18-Dec-20,Renee L.,5,,0,These masks were comfortable and fit well. We used them for a VERY dusty home improvement project- mixing floor leveling powder with water. We were impressed that they kept the odor and the dust out.
27-Dec-20,royalgreymini,5,,0,"With the current COVID surge, we wanted the most effective masks we could get. These are on the FDA EUA list, plus they’re very breathable and comfortable. I recently has to go in for some medical visits, and I was glad to have these masks."
26-Feb-21,Kawone,5,,0,"Comfortable to wear and great customer service! When I had an issue, the customer service replied in a timely manner and quickly addressed the issue. The products are packaged the same as when initially purchased and remain reliable."
29-Dec-20,Coldfinger 67,5,,0,I have been using the same KN95 since the summer so it was time to replace it.  These are reasonably priced and are a good fit.  Would have preferred them in a gray tone but those are hard to find.
29-Jan-21,gringo_caliente,1,One,1,"are these fake?  The strap broke immediately, three times"
26-Oct-20,Laura,5,One,0,"Excelente, me encanto! Muchas gracias! Buen precio y calidad Muy atentos y amables tambien"
19-Dec-20,J. Comer,5,,0,"These are the best masks we have found.  They fit perfectly, snug all around the edges.  The ear loops are comfortable.  We have tried many different kind of masks and these are by far the best."
7-Mar-21,Zoe,5,2,0,Tested by CDC.
30-Nov-20,Mariah,1,,1,These are knock-offs! Do not buy! I initially ordered a package in October and was very satisfied with the filtration quality and I saw they were on the fda list for emergency use approval. so I purchased two more when I started to run low. Imagine my disappoint when the new package of masks was much smaller and thinner than the one I ordered in October. I can also feel my breath through the front when I exhale. They do not have the same filtration quality and I ordered from my order history so I know the listing is the same. This is a scam. Do not buy!
28-Feb-21,Jeff Smith,5,,0,"This is my favorite mask so far, the fit is good and it feels more secure than most I’ve tried. There is a bit of ear soreness after 3 days of consistent use, but feeling safe and secure is worth it."
16-Dec-20,owl1516,4,,0,"I’m not sure if it meets the F.D.A. standards, but I’m 100% sure the fit is so tight that it kills my ears. So I won’t be purchasing them again. If you want a fit so tight it causes ear pain, buy it. Otherwise, I’d research another brand."
9-Feb-21,Goose Man,5,,0,These masks are comfortable and easy to adjust to your face. They provide the right amount of coverage and fit very well. They are suitable to be worn for long periods of time which in turn provides better protection and safety while setting the right example.
16-Dec-20,Wyojo,5,One,0,"Like the fit.  Comfy as a mask can be, I think"
16-Feb-21,yuet tong,1,One,1,"After I used a couple of the masks, I noticed the printings on the mask is in black, not in green as shown on the photo.  I am not sure if this pack is counterfeit or not, but I would not use it.  I wish Amazon can refund me or send me a pack of the authentic KN95 masks, but I have already open the pack and it’s too late to return."
26-Feb-21,Elizabeth McMurray,1,2,1,"These are fake, counterfeit masks. The real Powecom masks come with a verification barcode. These do not. The masks themselves also appear different than displayed in picture."
7-Nov-20,emalou,5,,0,I worked the polls on Election Day. A very looooong day. This mask is light and comfortable. You can manipulate the nose wire to fit your face. Felt very safe. No itch. Will order again.
30-Dec-20,dean p.,5,2,0,The mask is a little small for my face and I'm not a big person. If placed carefully It will cover pretty well but should be just a little bigger.
9-Mar-21,Sharon,5,,0,These are very comfortable and fit nicely to the face. I can't find any opening so assume they're doing what they're supposed to do. I wear glasses and didn't have any fogging. Would buy again.
22-Mar-21,Big Papa K,5,,0,"I’m really liking these masks. They are reasonably durable, feel pretty good on the face and breathable. These do a fairly decent job of keeping my glasses from fogging up. Recommended"
12-Feb-21,Richard U,2,,0,"Order placed Jan 31, 2021. Received Feb 12, 2021. There is no anti fake label on the package. The QC certificate inside the package says manufactured May 15, 2020. According to the Powecom website everything manufactured after May 20, 2020 will have an anti fake label. And the masks themselves are all white, no printing on them. All the pictures I've seen of these masks show green printing on the outer side. The masks appear to be well made, but I have no way to determine if they are the real deal."
25-Mar-21,audiodude,5,,0,"Excellent mask, has up to 99% filtering efficiency. Fits well and is durable. One of the best masks I have found - Number 1 of 9 different N95 type masks in the last year. Recommended"
31-Jan-21,David,5,One,0,These seal quite well and are generally very comfortable (as masks go that is).  I have some certified N95's and these are quite similar in fit and seal.
6-Feb-21,Sharon P,1,,1,"These masks can't possibly be protective. They have numerous see-through ""holes"" (that appear to have just a single layer of translucent fabric) all across the front. I suspect these are not authentic, though I also did not receive any sort of verification code. The QR code on the label just leads to a site to download the WeChat app. I'm seeing a lot of the same things that other reviewers mention. I wish I had read those reviews before ordering. Fortunately Amazon immediately refunded my money."
6-Feb-21,M C,1,One,1,This product is fraudulent.  The packaging that contained the masked was already opened at the bottom and concealed  by folding and taping.  The masks are not as pictured in the product image and description.  There is no stamp imprinting on the masks.  There is no Powecom Anti-Fake sticker on the package.  Requested a refund.
30-Nov-20,Sam,1,,1,I received mine after over a month of waiting. It's unlike the one I bought before. This one is a counterfeit: bag is open and dirty glue strip. It has no anti-fake validation sticker. It smells horrible!
28-Sep-20,Robert F.,5,,0,"Have bought these from another vendor online - they were over double the price. They are approved N95 masks. I've gotten others that didn't meet the US Governments minimum standards, and just as expensive"
26-Jan-21,RJ Mayer,4,,0,Very happy with the quality of these but of course they are overpriced. I sent this package to my mom in Florida as well as a package to our home. Unfortunately they are going to be needed for a long time
30-Dec-20,GMH,5,One,0,These are quality masks....very thick and protective. I wear them when I go into retail establishments. They can be worn for short periods numerous times since they are very sturdy.
25-Mar-21,M Weidner,4,,0,These are a little more comfortable than similar masks I get locally plus they stand away from my nose a little which eliminates my nose itch as compared to those I get locally.
23-Oct-20,J. Donaldson,5,,0,I ordered and use these masks to help protect other people from my breath. I realize it is not an N95 mask. It makes sense to me to wear it given the pandemic situation in 2020.
28-Jan-21,Rylee T.,5,,0,"Definitely do the job. Creates a good deal around my face, and just breathable enough. I’m pregnant and I wear these to my doctor’s office for that extra bit of protection."
29-Oct-20,Kindle Customer,5,,0,"KN95 masks are different from N95 masks in that they also have to pass a fit test. The vertical seam at the front of this mask design combined with the thickness of the material, keep this mask from being inhaled into my mouth. I found this mask does NOT fog up my glasses nearly as much as the N95 or cloth masks I also wear. Most likely because the fit is so good, air doesn’t escape from the sides of the mask but through the mask itself. Please wear a mask, stay safe and be well!"
30-Jan-21,Get real!,1,,1,Absolute Garbage! False advertising! Reviews and description say these are FDA approved. That is a bunch of BS as there is no way the FDA or anyone else would approve a mask with a line of holes all along the top of the mask. A single cloth mask will give you much better protection! Best use of these masks would be as toilette paper!
6-Oct-20,M. Herriman,4,,0,"The product I received was a stated in Amazon, so I am happy with it. I am less than happy with our postal service in the delivery,  USPS has become very unreliable this year."
13-Feb-21,ridgerunner,4,,0,"These seem to be good masks, but the earloops are a bit short. This makes the fit a bit tight. Pre stretching the loops helps a bit, but still may be a bit too tight for some."
16-Sep-20,Alp,1,One,0,It is a genuine and well made product.
11-Mar-21,R. Harrigan,3,,0,"Disappointed in this product. Really uncomfortable to wear, from the shape of the mask to the fact that the bands get caught on my ears in a painful way.  Wouldn't buy again."
24-Nov-20,KJ tech and gadgets,4,,0,Fits snug and it left a mark on my face which I’m not crazy about. Seems to not let air in through the sides like a others. A little harder to breathe in when you get hot.
28-Dec-20,Rick Tubbs,5,,0,They are a little tight. Also I didn’t like that they weren’t made in the USA. It would be helpful if you sold more product from our own country. Our folks need work.
18-Oct-20,jjl.rocks,4,,0,"Masked are well made, fit well only thing I didn't like is they have a slight odor sp I am airing them out. I can breathe well with them on and they are made as described."
28-Oct-20,send4hlp,4,,0,Appears 4 times on the approved list and once one the failed. This is normal and personally this product is already what I stock. No matter how you look at it it's better than a blue mask or a scarf!
24-Nov-20,C. Mark,5,,0,"These fit like a dream. Creates a nice seal around the edges, lightweight, holds its shape (doesn't collapse every time you inhale), plus they're on the list of EUA masks!"
31-Mar-21,Philip S. Taylor,5,,0,These masks protect well if worn properly.  They are also good at keeping down breath moisture steaming up glasses.  Does impede breathing somewhat.  Good value overall.
8-Feb-21,Rachel,1,2,1,The masks I received were fake. They were missing the authenticity sticker and the stamp on each one.
30-Sep-20,Dan C,1,One,0,Looks cheap
26-Sep-20,Happy Customer,5,,0,Got these fairly quick! Very thick and soft breathable material. I love that the company emails you a link to make sure that you are not getting counterfeit masks. Really appreciate the fast and friendly service so far.
30-Jan-21,Joe Schmo,1,,0,Loops are way too small for both my wife and I.  So tight they pull off the ears and the mask is on the verge of coming off.  I am all for a tight fit but this is child sized.
27-Oct-20,Helen Meehan,5,,0,We were in the middle of all the forest fires and the smoke was horrible.  These helped protect me from air quality of up to 438 and acted as the mask I need to wear anyway.
30-Jan-21,John Rigsby,4,,0,"These appear solid, I bought them not really knowing their size but that either they would fit me or my son. They fit my 9 year old son perfectly. Way too small for me."
23-Jan-21,Berry Lovering,5,3,0,I am a nurse and have worn N95 masks for years. This mask is very comfortable and has a great fit around the nose and chin.
1-Dec-20,Kory KRICK,5,,0,"These are going to protect better than surgical or cloth, make it fit properly and you'll get the equivalent of n95. I've had a ton of NIOSH N95, these are more comfortable."
3-Mar-21,Tometeaser,5,,0,"I was wearing a three ply mask, with a cloth face over it. This mask seals well, and they advise to not wear another mask over it because that deteriorates the seal. I'm very pleased with this mask."
27-Jan-21,Bromos,1,,0,Made in China
22-Nov-20,James C. Case,1,One,1,"These masks have lines of holes through them below the metal strip at the top. You can see through the holes. The fabric itself may filter, but the holes can let larger particles through. By particles,  I mean pencil lead size."
17-Feb-21,Carolyn Carrell,1,,0,"Made in China, would of never purchase them if I would have known they were made in China, is there any made in USA"
26-Jan-21,BABS,5,One,0,Fast delivery! Great fit! Love them!!
29-Nov-20,Kate Benek,2,,0,Made in china. I expect that to be disclosed.
8-Nov-20,k,5,3,0,"Excellent protection. The only ones firemen recommended. I was told you can use again if you carefully remove it, then place is a loose plastic bag or on a shelf for 3-4 days"
14-Nov-20,M,5,,0,"Fit a little better than the last N95 masks I got on Amazon.  Like these.  Wish they were individually packaged, but that's a minor quibble.  I feel safe wearing them"
30-Jan-21,Shawn H.,1,2,1,The two bags of masks I received were not sealed and had holes in the masks.
31-Oct-20,John,5,One,0,"Made two separate orders of these and both were authentic when I checked the numbers on their website. Nice quality KN95, better than the ones my work gives me."
17-Feb-21,Greenbrier Girl,4,,0,I am happy with these masks because they are tight all the way around. No gaps under the chin or on the sides.  The only critique I can give is that they are a little too tall for me. They push up under my eyes a little to close.  But I feel much safer in these than in any other I have worn.
29-Oct-20,trish,4,,0,"My ears went numb the first week or two I wore these but the confidence that my mask was secure and snug around my face even when I talked made me push through! Now I don’t have the pain around the ears. Push through the pain-it’s worth the security. And while other fools have their dang noses hanging out and having to adjust every other word, you’re just sat there with a hidden smile 😊"
26-Feb-21,Lisa M. Burnett,5,,0,"I don’t know if people are getting a different mask than I am but mine are on the FDA approved list and when I wear one and I blow on a candle, it doesn’t even flicker. So much more comfortable than cloth or paper masks and don’t bother my ears at all."
17-Nov-20,Joan Husman,5,One,0,"These Masks are very safe and effective, however the ear straps are too short and the back of your ears become irritated with a long period of use"
10-Feb-21,Kitty,1,,1,These masks have no identifying information printed on them (like picture of item shows) to indicate they are actually on the approved list. Will dispose of these. Buyer beware.
18-Oct-20,Tom A.,5,,0,It arrived a day earlier kudos to the seller I was in the wild fire area so this was much needed seems to work well in the smoke no complaints. like it alot
6-Oct-20,Kelly,2,,1,Thin and seems to not protect equally through out. Some areas such as the dotted holes looks like there isn’t protection at all that’s how out w thin it is
13-Sep-20,Rowland Wells,4,One,0,"I did the scratch off on the back and the verification checked out for me.  Ordered a back up bundle.  These may not be NIOSH but they're made well, don't smell and are better than our hand stitched double cloth masks with shop towels ( > 95% particulate, at least according to FDA).  I'd rather the NIOSH go to first responders but these are good for family back up."
11-Oct-20,Ben Eng,5,,0,"I love how tight of a seal the mask creates. Yes, it is small but it's not an issue.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I bought 1 pack to try it and was sold on the comfort and perceived effectiveness and bought a 2nd pack.  I will likely buy a 3rd pack soon."
24-Mar-21,Faith G,5,,0,These masks fit well on my face and are very comfortable. They don't make me feel like I can't get any air because they don't crowd my mouth. I recommend.
17-Feb-21,Misha,5,,0,Once we became a Covid hot zone-I got these for my job as a teacher. These are literally the only masks that don’t fall down when I speak or muffle my voice.
5-Feb-21,David,5,,0,"Regular kn95 masks. They are useful and I use them when I go out in public such as work, grocery stores and etc. they take time to get used to compared to the other masks that let you breathe easier. All in all, it protects from getting covid and spreading covid."
12-Sep-20,info,5,One,0,Good product and move anti-counterfactual system
29-Mar-21,Ryan Luby,5,,0,I chose these masks specifically because they have an actual FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). They fit very well - among the best I’ve purchased over the last year.
26-Feb-21,Douglas H.,5,,0,"These are good.  We've been wearing the same masks a few times per day for a couple of weeks.  No problems with ear loops pulling out, which seems to be the most common problem with masks."
9-Feb-21,Stans07a,2,,1,"The anti-counterfeit label went to a dead website for mine. The ear loops are way too small for an adult. And there are heat welds all over that I can't believe passed CDC/FDA tests, but the Q&A here says they do, so . . ."
19-Feb-21,Tia,5,One,0,Thumbs up
15-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,3,,0,Material doesn't allow breathing!
8-Feb-21,Dwight L. Davis,4,,0,I gave these to my friends as I found the elastic on the ear hooks too short and they were uncomfortable as a result.  Appear to be well constructed.
4-Dec-20,josmanmay,5,,0,Finally I’m using this KN95 and so far it’s been satisfying wearing it. It did came on time and cheaper compare to other brands. Highly recommended...
22-Mar-21,Michael,3,,0,"I use these as one layer of a double mask layer. Other KN95 masks are slightly more expensive, but these pull my ears and are fairly uncomfortable."
16-Feb-21,A. Brooks,4,,0,"Good masks, but edging is sharp—like a stiff fabric shirt tag. I can only wear for about an hour before it really starts to irritate my chin area."
20-Aug-20,qiong hua zheng,5,2,0,compared to the other two types of KN95 masks I bought this one has a better quality. my glasses don't fog up when I wear the mask.
30-Nov-20,Epi,5,,0,I wear glasses. Finally something that doesn't fog them! I believe its thanks to the firm metal piece on top not letting air out up into my eyes.
7-Dec-20,A. New,4,,0,"I'm hoping they'll turn up, but this morning it appears that they've left the premises.  Be extra careful with storing popular items like these."
2-Dec-20,K. McDonald,4,,0,Able to get a decent deal. I’m an RN and I have fit tested n95s at work. I’d say this seal as not as good as those but definitely better than a surgical mask.
4-Dec-20,John D. Paden,5,,0,"To where for 8-16 hours straight, I attached a cloth to pull it behind my head. Very uncomfortable to wear for that long. Good tight fit, durable construction."
20-Oct-20,Johnny Dee,5,,0,"These are quite comfortable, and can be used several times. They offer more protection for the wearer then cloth masks, from what I understand."
23-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,,1,"I bought the mask believing that they were legit, I have COPD, and am high risk. To find out after looking them up that these are false.  Imagine my disappointment. I wish I had read the reviews first. Just filed a complaint with the better business bureau."
20-Jan-21,Gabriela Rosenwald,4,,0,"I was looking for N95 , Not KN95 de different are N95 protect better and most of the cases is make in US . KN95 protect 90 % and is make in China."
30-Sep-20,Jay D Lapidus,5,,0,"Happy with these masks. They fit a smaller face well and are as comfortable as any KN-95 mask would be. The only thing I  don't like is the visible writing on the mask, and I wish they came in colors to make them look a little less utilitarian, but neither is a dealbreaker. Good quality masks, and the best for filtering out pollution and protecting against COVID-19."
12-Sep-20,F. White,5,One,0,"Verified FDA EUA. Anti-theft numbers came up as valid on the website. To-date, all the packages I have opened have been manufactured in 2020."
21-Nov-20,Sean,1,One,1,"These are flimsy, thin masks.  Do not be fooled by the ""K"" N95 verbiage.  These masks feel much less substantial than an N95 by 3M, for example.  These are probably on par with surgical masks, which can be purchased for much less.  I feel scammed."
29-Jan-21,CS,4,One,0,They fit wonderfully.  Marked down because it has an odd smell.  I’m going to see if an airing before wearing will help.
25-Nov-20,R. Raisanen,5,,0,These are the real deal and on the FDA list. Not as good as a N95 but better than surgical or cloth mask.  The mask I received were not counterfeit?
26-Oct-20,Erika Astle,5,,0,"Very thick, sturdy, and a bit stiff. Felt like wearing a Halloween bird beak, but the construction is so good it holds up very well. Great value."
19-Oct-20,Patti,5,One,0,"The fit of these masks are much more comfortable then other KN95s I have used. Still snug fitting but without too much behind the ear pressure. You are also able to verify, after to you receive the product, that they are certified."
19-Aug-20,Justin DelMuto,5,One,0,"The masks fit great, FDA approved, 4 thick layers of protection, and keeps over 95% filtered out. I also liked that it was delivered in 2 days and packaged perfectly! They are almost and maybe just as good as N95 masks, which are at least double the price! Highly recommend!"
6-Feb-21,bloodhoundgrl,5,,0,"Verification scan code on the package, fit good but stand up off your face enough to be breathable. I've been using them for a couple of months and have not had an ear band break yet."
13-Feb-21,Pecosd,5,,0,"This mask is a well fitting mask. The best I have used so far. It felt too tight the first time I wore one, but I got used to it. A mask that is too loose doesn’t get the job done."
4-Dec-20,corzet,5,,0,"Awesome and great quality. I plan to purchase more from this company only! I’m encouraging others to do the same. So far, this has been the best KN95 mask on the market and believe me, I have a lot of them!☺️"
4-Feb-21,Robert Sheldon,1,,0,No returns. Buy if you have a small head.
3-Sep-20,Rachael,5,One,0,I was very happy to find these on Amazon. I love that they are fda approved and we have something to verify authenticity. The anti fake check is nice and works well too. I clicked twice by mistake and saw it worked. It made me feel more secure
2-Mar-21,Elizabeth,5,,0,I was glad to find good masks at a reasonable price that don’t have a vent since airlines and medical facilities no longer allow them.
6-Dec-20,Mario Garcia,1,One,1,This is a knock-off mask. You can do a simple test by putting some water inside the mask and seeing if it leaks. These masks leaked when I performed that test. Don’t buy them.
16-Feb-21,WET,2,,1,"See Photo - There are holes where the materials are fused together.  So if you're getting this for better protection, look elsewhere."
4-Mar-21,Atch,1,,1,"Not what I expected, and not returnable."
1-Nov-20,Annie,4,,0,"The ear loops are a bit short and kinda hurt the back of you ears.  The mask itself has good coverage but is hot, as most masks are."
16-Jan-21,Kindle Customer,5,,0,"These are comfy, allow you to breathe better than flat, medical-style masks. Extra layers give best protection. And they fit well."
22-Feb-21,kmf,4,,0,"A friend of mine gave me a kn95 mask, which fit my face ok, although it was a tad too long. These, however, are even larger and unwearable for me. I have a small face, I'm a female, 110 lbs and most masks are too large. These were just extra large, so I gave them away to some people with normal-sized faces."
7-Sep-20,LRG,5,One,0,They are very confortable to wear and very sturdy for regular use.  I prefer this mask over all the others I have used in the past six months.
7-Feb-21,RubyRooby,5,,0,These masks are super comfortable and I feel like I can breathe better in them than the ones that squish up against my face. That are nice and stretchy too. I liked them so much I bought a pack for my parents and another for my in-laws.
12-Jan-21,Carol R.,5,,0,"Since N95 masks are not available, I purchased these.  They are better than the cloth masks. They fit well and I would recommend these to anyone wanting a better mask."
2-Dec-20,dawneiegirl,5,,0,These KN-95 masks work well.  they fit well.  I needed a little more protection than cloth due to medical reasons and these work well.
18-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,2,1,Real N95 masks don't come with ear loops but durable rubber band straps to create a seal on the face.
26-Feb-21,K.Fox,5,,0,"Comfortable and lightweight while still keeping its shape. It doesn't ride up into my eyes, either, like a lot of masks do."
25-Aug-20,Julia,5,One,0,The masks fit well they are easier to breathe through than some other brands KN95 are. The seller contacted me after I placed the order that there will be anti fake label authentication. It verified for me. Will order them again.
20-Feb-21,LCG556,5,,0,These are the most comfortable and secure KN95 masks I’ve worn yet! I’m am really surprised by the quality for the money!
7-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,One,1,These are not real and approved KN95 masks. There are no NIOSH logo on masks. Real ones straps are over the head not hooked on ears. They should not be calling these KN95 masks as they are not effective as the real things. False advertising!
3-Dec-20,Joel D.,3,,0,I have an unusually large head and they fit too tight for me. I cut one and saw that it had six layers which should mean that it gives adequate protection
27-Dec-20,Joe Borda,5,,0,"While the item was delayed, they offered and shipped me another set of masks Fedex priority mail. They also allowed me to keep the original set of masks, which finally did arrive (delayed due to USPS) which is great! Their customer service was very responsive and the products are good. I feel safe wearing them and appreciate the help and assistance in the shipping errors (again due to USPS)."
14-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,This mask fits me very well. It has a very durable nose clip. It is more comfortable to breathe through. I highly recommend this masks!
29-Mar-21,Wise Old Owl,4,,0,"For non-reusable, they are very comfortable, block air from fogging glasses and fit tight to face without generating perspiration."
14-Sep-20,Shawn T. Pearson,5,,0,"These seem to function well.  They appear to better fit people with smaller heads.  I have a relatively tall head and it works okay as long as I don't talk too much or chew gum.  If I do, it slips down my nose."
18-Dec-20,Ramkumar,5,One,0,The masks work well and are good
25-Jan-21,BluEyesCat,4,One,0,"I usually use a different brand KN95 mask, this mask is a little larger and fits better. Had a smell at first that disappeared."
9-Oct-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,For the price these were comfortable..you must understand if your looking for high quality mask you would have to pay more or probably wont even find any ..so these worked just fine..if you feel like extra barrier add a good layer clothed mask over it. my husband n I love it for Airport n visiting my elderly mother.No complaints here!!
5-Feb-21,Bill C,5,,0,Came when scheduled & appears to be as described.  Like the fit.  Others have been too bulky & did not fit as well.
31-Aug-20,cathy blaszak,4,One,0,Their customer service was top notch and not only assured me of authenticity but also directed me to the Government department where I could look it up myself. I am happy with the mask and fit and feel very protected while wearing it.
30-Oct-20,Sandy,5,,0,"Powecom, I just left a glowing review and could do so often. A jewel of a company, treating clients as if they are most important and valuable. Masks are fantastic. Thank you, Powecom!"
1-Nov-20,Amazonca,5,,0,Very Happy with this mask. It's very comfortable to wear and the earloops do not hurt the ears. The metal nose piece is very flexible and I am able to adjust it well enough so that my glasses don't fog up.
1-Aug-20,Barbara E Adams,5,3,0,The product fit well and it was easy to breathe normally when doing mild exercises like brisk walking - e.g. 3 miles
12-Oct-20,JJ White,5,,0,"The masks arrived quickly. They are comfortable, thick and feel better than expected. I'm very happy with this purchase."
27-Feb-21,George & Eileen,5,,0,Nice size. Fit well. They seem to work well and fits snugly around nose and mouth. Planning on buying them again.
17-Feb-21,Michelle,1,,0,My husband and I both put a mask on.  I took mine off really quickly it was like plastic or something was on the inside my face started sweating right away.  Also it was too tight.  My husband wore his for a little longer thought nice and tight but soon he took it off.  He had marks on his face where the mask and the elastic was. NEVER buy these again.  Very unhappy. waste of money
7-Mar-21,A. Glover,5,,0,These masks are well made.  It must be kept perfectly centered on your face for the ear loops to not snap loose.
20-Feb-21,Florence F.,1,,1,"There are irrigated holes across both the top and bottom of the mask. Straight across, very comfortable although I'm not sure it's much use against airborne particulates."
4-Sep-20,Genesis,4,One,0,"These work and have a nice fit even with a short beard/stubble. The only issue is these aren't very breathable, but they definitely feel safer than a cloth mask."
22-Dec-20,Lyle,5,,0,"We are very happy to have found these masks, which are FDA listed for Emergency Use Authorization. The anti-fake QR codes on both bags were good. We had a hard time scraping the coating with a coin, but it was easy to scrape off with a knife. They are comfortable and easy to breathe through. We just bought a bag for each of our relatives' homes."
18-Dec-20,John3,4,,0,One mask started to split apart from the bottom. Top edge tends to creep up into your eyes. Mediocre design.
17-Feb-21,Consumer A,5,,0,Purchased for my mother who reports she is very happy with the fit and comfort of this mask. A good purchase.
5-Feb-21,Jessica B.,5,,0,All good at this time. Believe they’re genuine and good quality. Verification shows genuine at least on mine.
10-Feb-21,tea,5,,0,Great mask had a great price With this mask no need to double mask unless you just want It is that good
29-Jan-21,Betty Doles,5,,0,They run a little high up the nose. Also into the eye area.  The thickness seems good as to protect you from the virus.
24-Oct-20,Texas Tech Home Economist,5,,0,This is the mask you want to buy.  It is built right.  I bought from two other vendors.  They were trash.
28-Jan-21,Dennis Hoang,1,2,1,Received generic white mask in Powecom KN95 bag.
10-Nov-20,Ando,5,,0,"I don't know what they mean about stretch. I can only say they fit well. Can't get N95 Masks, These supposedly are the second best that you can get at this point."
1-Sep-20,Ladybug,5,One,0,I am very pleased with these face masks. They are the first ones that I have seen that are certified to be authentic.
11-Oct-20,D. Navarre,5,,0,"They fit the face perfectly, covering the mouth and nose. I feel safe wearing them. They clean up nice."
25-Feb-21,CocoPup,4,,0,"Good product, only issue I found is that the straps are a little tighter than some KN95 masks. Packaged in packs of 10.  (Wish they were packaged each)"
5-Mar-21,J. Nickels,5,,0,"These face masks give me more confidence in filtering the air.  They are lightweight, comfortable and easy to breathe."
4-Nov-20,SU,4,,0,High quality and comfortable mask with secure ear loops. The translucent lines where the layers are fused together can be brittle and punctured if roughly handled (e.g. with long nails) compared to other KN95 with a different design (line of translucent “dots”where layers are fused). Overall good product
20-Aug-20,baat,4,,0,Fast shipping. Fit great and feels quality made. Great customer service. I do not go into large crowds so I did not check the FDA website for authenticity.
5-Feb-21,S. Guy,5,,0,"Why would u want it to stretch, it’s a mask!  maybe the. Ear loops?. Thiese give you space to breath"
22-Feb-21,Mike F.,4,,0,"Fits well, is comfortable. Seems a little thinner than other masks I have tried but hopefully is as protective!"
29-Jan-21,Bonnie B.,5,,0,Very comfortable. Light weight even if you want to wear under another cotton mask foe extra protection.
31-Aug-20,N. Pickard,5,,0,Have waited a long time to get a quality face mask on Amazon. The packaging and fit are excellent as well as the price. More confident purchase having the anti fraud check capability also.
13-Nov-20,L.M. Johnson,4,,0,They do the job but are like all mask.  You know you have it on!  Relatively comfortable and snug fit!
28-Jan-21,macombschool,4,,0,Those are some really good quality masks. They fit tight and mold well on the nose. The ear loops are pretty tight but they are great for kids. Adults should possibly use extenders.
25-Dec-20,Marie O.,3,One,0,Same as the headline.
6-Feb-21,KindleFire17,1,,1,These do not have the head straps but just ear loops. According to the CDC that means they are fake.
14-Feb-21,Kindle Fire,5,,0,"Good  quality, fits face well, ear loops are good, secure wire over nose is comfortable. 👍"
9-Apr-21,Vivian Gallardo,5,,0,"El material es bueno, también el acabado, pero solo sirve para mujeres, mi esposo no puede usarlas, son muy pequeñas."
4-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,1,One,1,"Tried doing a water leak test, and this mask started leaking water after 10seconds. Another brand of KN95 masks held the water without leaking at all. Stay away from this brand. Shame on whoever is peddling this trashy mask."
3-Mar-21,Okaasan,5,,0,I like it better than cloth masks.  There is room between the mask and my face because of the cone shape.
11-Oct-20,Bryan,5,,0,"These masks are very good, sometimes the ears straps are a bit tight but you can stretch them. Comfortable to wear all day. Not stamped like cheap masks. Last about a week each then you can tell it gets a bit harder to breath. Highly recommended however!"
31-Jan-21,Teresa Hixson,5,,0,Well made product. Fits comfortably and seems to block out more than just the cloth masks do.
6-Feb-21,Chuck,1,,0,"These are really badly made masks. Very low quality construction, they don't fit well on your face and are very small.  I would recommend looking elsewhere for masks.  They are also non returnable, although Amazon was kind enough to refund my money, you will have to jump through a few hoops to get that to happen."
23-Oct-20,Provider!,5,One,0,Very comfortable no weird  smell . Thank you!
28-Jan-21,Picasso,1,One,1,The bag was already open.
6-Mar-21,elizabeth,5,,0,My husband is a believer in these masks and has ordered them for his siblings and mother too.
21-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,1,,1,"The Mask was not manufactured or shipped by innovative tech, but instead by Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supplies. The quality was cheaper. There were holes that you could see through in various parts of the mask.The masks was very tight to the face. I  would not chance the saftey of my life or families with this mask. Plus the correct manufacturers and shippers sell it for alot less."
23-Feb-21,mailmommy,1,,0,The bands keep falling off my  ears ..too small. If you have  a small face..this ones for you.
28-Jan-21,Van T. Huynh,3,,1,Not as advertised or shown in pictures. Mask shown in pictures does not the holes and is completely covered. Packaging is the same as the ones I have at home but they are definitely different masks. You get what you pay for. Good thing they are to be worn under another masks.
8-Oct-20,Meema,5,,0,It fits well and completely covers my nose as well as under my chin and around my cheeks.
26-Jan-21,Kimmysis,5,,0,I love that you can scan a code to verify it isn’t a knockoff. Mask fits well on my face.
30-Dec-20,Giulia Sanchez,5,One,0,I got it for my first trip during COVID-19 and I loved! I used it during all my flight and I felt so safe. I really think this mask protect me way more than other ones. The material was really good. Price is so good since came with 10 mask. I definitely recommend it for everyone that wants to feel more safe.
9-Feb-21,jmunicorn,1,,0,The ear loops are not comfortable for adults.
23-Nov-20,dannyjap,5,,0,Like that they are very light and I can talk better..  I'm very happy that I orderthis .
24-Nov-20,Chris Everton,1,One,1,These are NOT FDA approved as stated. They were pulled 6+ months ago from an approved list after testing. These are not real KN95 masks.
23-Jan-21,Suzette,5,One,0,Very happy with comfort & fit! Best mask I’ve worn. Just ordered more. These Kn95 Powecom masks are on the approved FDA list for covid-19 protection. Highly recommend.
12-Feb-21,BigOleGator,5,,0,Good quality product but they aren’t comfortable for long periods of time....can get dirty quickly if using outside or in a physical work environment.
15-Nov-20,Ray,5,,0,Pros: Reliable and Sturdy Cons: There is a smell. You get used to it though.
5-Apr-21,Nana,5,,0,I like that the seal is excellent and I feel well protected when I am wearing the mask.
16-Nov-20,Steve Stocker,4,,0,"As some others have mentioned, the straps are quite tight and I feel like my ears are going to be cut off.  However this does create a very tight fit on the face, which is good I think.  If you can adjust to this very tight feeling then I think this is a good mask for you."
1-Apr-21,MH,5,,0,I keep unused masks in my car so I can offer one to someone who forgot his/her mask by paying it forward.
25-Jan-21,Bill wigley,5,,0,"I love these masks, yet they look like a duck bill.  They do fig my glasses when I talk"
5-Mar-21,C Simmons,5,,0,Soft. No problem breathing . Stays put. Ear bands don't hurt.will buy again.well made.
31-Jan-21,A. He,1,,1,"It’s so hard trying to buy actual KN95 masks. These are fake, they don’t look like the images on the webpage. They have little holes everywhere not the solid lines as shown in the pictures. One package came opened. do not buy these, they’re fake and useless."
18-Feb-21,DJC210,5,,0,"Great price, fits nice and snug around the nose, chin, and sides but stays away from my face inside the mask.  The result is that my face stays cooler and doesn't sweat inside tke mazk.  I will definitely order them again when I need to replenish my supply."
21-Nov-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,Really good quality and for a great price too. They fit comfortably for any size. They come in clean easy packaging too. Definitely will be buying from them again soon.

15-Feb-21,KIPP,5,,0,They seem to work well. At least I hope so. There made in china but seem to be well made.
9-Feb-21,Laraine Beltran,1,,1,These are not for medical use! The perforations on the front make them absolutely useless for prevention of the spread of COVID! Do NOT buy of that's your intent!
29-Mar-21,Sirwackman,4,,0,"Adequate for the circumstances. Could be a little bigger, as it pulls on ear lobes."
15-Feb-21,Battlepoint,5,,0,I think this would fit a woman's face perfectly.  Too small for my face.  Otherwise no complaints.
1-Dec-20,J. W. MN.,4,,0,Mask is OK but elastic is not long enough or stretchy enough.  Keep looking...
9-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,,1,The dark spots in the pic are the cover of the book I inserted for contrast. The rows of holes are on both sides and render the mask next to useless for its intended purpose.
7-Mar-21,Den Andy,5,,0,This face mask does cover your nose and mouth very well. This is a good buy.
19-Mar-21,fraukuech,5,,0,"I don't love the feel of KN95 masks. But then again, I don't love the feel of any masks. I do love the peace of mind this provides."
1-Dec-20,Yeoman Johnson,5,,0,The ear straps do not irritate my ears like the cords that most masks use. Very nice!
10-Nov-20,Kiminak,4,,0,"Bought specifically for our flight out of state. They worked well, easy to breathe on plane without getting hot."
23-Mar-21,D.B.,1,,1,The masks have lines of literal holes punched across them rendering them useless.
19-Oct-20,Artemis2,5,,0,"Love these masks. They are comfortable to wear, provide excellent face coverage, and don’t cause fogging of eyeglasses. I’ll be reordering more once my supply is used up. Highly recommend."
7-Sep-20,Laksh,5,2,0,FDA Approved masks gives me more confident to use for COVID. Validated the anti fake check and I have received a genuine masks. Happy with the purchase.
26-Sep-20,marita reeves,5,One,0,"Solid design, but its gets gross from the air too fast,like you can see the dirt build up from the air. I live in Clackamas near where the 2 major fires were and these masks definitely helped quell the pollutes from getting through."
4-Feb-21,Joseph L,5,,0,"This is second order.  These masks are comfortable, supply a good seal on the face, and therefore are no problem to use.  The FDA review also counts in a world of hype."
18-Mar-21,Karen M.G.,5,,0,"I loved everything about this mask - comfort, protected + lite as a feather!"
10-Feb-21,mara schlanger,1,2,1,These masks are counterfeit. They are not the real Powecom masks.
28-Dec-20,Chris,4,,0,Decent and hope it works. Little small for length wise for adult male.
26-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,"Love this light weight face mask. The fit and seal is great...no gaps. It lifts out away from my face so I can talk easier.  The ear loops are very comfortable. I feel more protected in this mask, than any others I bought during the pandemic. Have purchased them twice and will buy again."
24-Feb-21,"""turn4""",5,,0,"Easy to breathe, fits well, sometimes requires re-adjustment to control blowback.  I bought this item because it was on the FDA EUA list."

28-Oct-20,Jennifer Marie Hair,5,,0,"These KN95 masks are exactly what I was looking for. They arrived promptly, and their customer service was excellent when I reached out with a question about the verification process. They quickly resolved my issue, and I was able to verify the product code. We will definitely buy more of these in the future."
9-Aug-20,juan jesus oleaga,5,3,0,Is a good mask and you can verify with a code on the original label. Fit perfectly on my face.
26-Dec-20,w. waldo,5,,0,great for those who have difficulty breathing with other style of mask
23-Dec-20,R. See,5,,0,"Bought a pack of these for a flight and they were great. It formed a really good seal all around and stayed pretty snug on my face. I don't really have experience with too many other masks, but the straps on this one are quite soft. I don't notice them while wearing them, even though they had been on for a solid 4 hours."
7-Nov-20,Steve in Hawaii,5,,0,Product as advertised but there are probably others just as good but less expensive???
19-Nov-20,JT@WNC,5,,0,Good mask for dusty work and covid. Hard to get these! Thank you.

24-Jan-21,russ,5,,0,"I wish I didn't have to buy a whole 10-pack of these, because that's far more than what I'm going to need for myself.  A 3-pack or a 5-pack would be a better deal for individuals."
17-Mar-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,"Certified, and fulfills the function for which it is designed."
18-Mar-21,MarciaA,5,,0,This product was split open when I received it.  I hope it is safe to use.

1-Apr-21,Lawrence R. Severt,5,,0,They do what masks are designed to do.  Not much more to say.

5-Oct-20,James D,5,,0,Masks are very comfortable and a proper size. They fit properly without being too tight and are larger than ones I had purchased from another vendor. The fact that they are on the approved list of manufacturers is very important. Very pleased.

4-Sep-20,nephrontx,5,One,0,"Very comfortable to wear, yet provides the much needed protection. Highly recommend"
23-Nov-20,Ruth Parks,1,One,0,"1st fact is NOT American made!!! I specifically put American made in the search. Was misleading on that issue. Should have read MUCH closer. Ear loops are too short, even for me."
29-Mar-21,Laura Ponce,5,,0,"Good thickness, easy to breath with them, ear elastics a bit short."
17-Oct-20,be the teaching,5,,0,"I had some questions about my order. The seller was prompt in answering them and helping me. The product “ Powecom KN95 Face Mask Reusable, Disposable Masks” is high quality and works well."

3-Apr-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,They work very well either was 1 mask or under a pretty 1...
9-Sep-20,Henrique Marangon Formolo,5,2,0,Quality is noticeable and it feels very comfortable. Efficiency is not guaranteed (like any other mask I guess) but I feel much more safe when using this one than any other one I have ever tried.
30-Mar-21,AMD,5,,0,Fit perfectly and cups the chin for better protection.
15-Feb-21,Gripper,5,,0,Nice tight fit but comfortable. Frayed on FDA report.

21-Nov-20,Helen M. Robinson,5,,0,Good coverage. Great fit. Breathable. Durable. Attractive.
1-Jan-21,Arun,1,One,0,This product is too small. The elastic on both sides is too small and it really hurts or bends the ear on both sides. I ordered this item for international travel this week. Extremely uncomfortable to wear it through your the flight. I won’t recommend this product.
16-Aug-20,kennetta,5,2,0,Mask is very easy to breathe and provides secure fit on face while showing one of the best filtration percentages according to testing. Also the anti fraud sticker provides confidence you are getting the real deal.
19-Oct-20,L. Sexton,5,,0,Great product. Fast shipping. And it is a N95 which is far better personal protection.
22-Mar-21,Daisy11,5,,0,"Fits snugly to the face. If the ear straps pull on your ears, stretching them out a bit helps loosen them and makes them more comfortable. Might sound intuitive but figured it wouldn’t hurt to mention it :)"
7-Sep-20,PT,5,One,0,"Very sturdy and comfortable masks, and no unpleasant smells"
5-Apr-21,MJ,5,,0,As comfortable as a mask can be.  Good fit and seal.

29-Oct-20,Darlene,5,,0,The price and the comfort. I use them for work.
22-Feb-21,Bluegrass Shopper,5,,0,Fits great on my big face. Will be buying more.
1-Sep-20,Mrudula,5,One,0,I feel the comfort of using these masks and best thing is it is FDA approved. Highly recommend this product. My kid uses this daily for her school and I feel safe with this mask.
7-Oct-20,Benjamin Drewry,5,,0,Good quality mask and even feels nice on your face
20-Mar-21,shenny,4,,0,The only downside is I wish the price was lower.
7-Mar-21,CTS,4,,0,"The ear loops are a little snug. I’m an average sized person, so anyone with a wider/fuller face may find these uncomfortable."
8-Oct-20,D. Braunecker,5,,0,"Of the masks I've tried, this is the most comfortable.  I use it at the gym where masks are still required."
8-Feb-21,B. Haubrich,5,,0,Very good coverage.  Glasses don't steam up.  Excellent fit.
5-Dec-20,GGE,5,,0,Very comfortable to use. I highly recommend it.
30-Sep-20,Jeff Lankford,5,One,0,Typical KN95 mask. POWECOM adds value by being on FDA authorized import list AND by using an anti-fake label. Beware fake products and other junk.
18-Aug-20,Ann F Symonds,5,2,0,I like that there is a security code to enter to ensure it is not a fake and that it is listed on the approved FDA list of KN95 masks.  Seems to be the real deal!
20-Jan-21,Deb,4,,0,This mask is a good fit and is as advertised
21-Mar-21,JB,5,,0,Authentic mask per FDA  fit is ok  Didn’t have any eyeglass fogging.
27-Jan-21,Terry,5,,0,"So far these are the best mask we have found. They are designed like a N-95, are very comfortable to wear, fit tight to your nose and face and have 5 layers of fabric. Would definitely by them again."
11-Feb-21,julie pearson,1,,0,DO NOT BUY. These are NOT adult size. They are so small loops do not fit behind my ears and then they break off from trying. Most adult size masks are slightly large on me so these have to be child-sized. Since they can’t be returned do not waste your money if you want adult size.
10-Sep-20,arovia butler,5,One,0,"Great value, like that you can check to make sure it is authentic"
17-Mar-21,nightflh,5,,0,Hard to breath through the mask  fit well
11-Nov-20,Anu.B,5,,0,It is comfortable plus closely snugs to nose and mouth without discomfort.
5-Feb-21,Dot,5,,0,These are junk. Save your money. Amazon will not refund or return.
6-Mar-21,Mermaid,5,,0,Easier breathing than other masks. I clean with a blue light wand and reuse. Use medical tape on nose to keep from fogging up glasses.
11-Dec-20,Julia,4,,0,The fit of theses work well since they are permanently creased by a seam down the middle.  That means you don’t breath in the fabric like cloth masks. They also cover well. A shout out to the company who immediately sent a replacement packet by UPS when the one I ordered got lost/stuck in the mail (which I could track).
23-Dec-20,Kristicat,5,,0,"Mask was very comfortable. Nice and heavy, but did not obstruct my breathing. I bought these to travel. I flew from Ca to Fla."

3-Nov-20,Pra Par,5,,0,Very happy to have to KN95 which in the approval list
14-Oct-20,Dan S.,4,,0,"These masks were smaller than the KN95 masks I had from another vendor.  They worked OK for my wife, but not as well for me.  I needed more mask width for my face."
25-Sep-20,Margel Torrence,5,,0,"Was skeptical at first to order, but after reading the reviews I decided to try the product.  I am pleased with the quality of the material and the fit is good.  Had a little mix up with the order but the seller fixed that promptly. I will order this item again and refer to my friends.  Thanks"
24-Oct-20,Virginia E. Vida,5,,0,"The mask fits snugly on my face but it’s comfortable, too.  Makes me feel secure."

16-Dec-20,F. Bortel,5,,0,Good quality. Easy to breath. Read in  yahoo news article that they were fda  approved.
11-Aug-20,Bill X.,5,One,0,Item arrived surprisingly much earlier than estimated and its outlook pretty much matches the description. I’m going to use it for my upcoming trip and I’ll update the review after I get back. Hope it works fine since it’s hard to find ‘FDA’ stuff these days.
12-Nov-20,DGP,5,,0,Easy to use. Comfortable.
1-Dec-20,J5,1,,1,These masks are counterfeit.  The package does not have the special sticker on it with the QR code you can use to look up the validity on the powecom website.  Without that who knows where these came from.  I'll be returning these.  Buyer beware.
2-Feb-21,Bob,1,,0,Do not buy! Masks have a very strong perfume smell. It makes them very unpleasant to wear and the smell stays on you afterwards.
18-Feb-21,Alda,5,,0,Comfort and stretch item
25-Nov-20,filbert,4,,0,They have a strong odor.
1-Sep-20,Abby,5,,0,MY HUSBAND AND I COULD NOT WEAR THEM AS THE EAR ELASTICS WERE TOO SHORT. IT HURT OUR EARS. GAVE THEM TO THE GRANDKIDS AND THEY FIT WELL.
26-Mar-21,Shopaholic,5,,0,Great value for the money.
19-Feb-21,rsv2105,5,,0,I was able to verify the authenticity of the mask through Powecom website. The only downside is that the masks do not have individual packaging.
13-Oct-20,Barbara A. Tarvid,5,,0,As advertised. Packaged nicely.
1-Jan-21,James C.,5,,0,"They work great, fit well. Stay protected."
6-Mar-21,Mausmobile,1,One,1,Knock off I still use them.
17-Feb-21,CVCA,5,,0,"The first order of masks that I received and tried to verify as authentic were possible ""fakes"".  I contacted the company and received a response immediately.  They sent a replacement by FedEx the next day and thankfully those masks were verified as authentic. The masks are comfortable and fit well."
4-Feb-21,philomena wurche,1,,0,This mask is really uncomfortable. I have a small face and it’s really tight and hurts my face.  It is also itchy  Wore it for a short time and had a large imprint on my face. Wish I had seen it was not returnable
16-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,Quality and comfort was perfect in every aspect of performance.

18-Mar-21,HGK,5,,0,Exactly as described. Able to verify authenticity.
30-Jan-21,Gelica,4,,0,Works well! Can breath easily. Doesn't fog my glasses. The ear loops hurt my ear but most masks do. I use an extender which helps.

19-Mar-21,Georgina Cooper,5,,0,I used these recently and found them effective and comfortable
4-Feb-21,Holly,2,,1,"Lets an alarming amount of moisture through and slides up the face. My 3-layer cotton masks filter more moisture than these. However I can't say I'm too surprised, they're an EUA product, not a formally approved/tested one. Still better than nothing"
19-Feb-21,rtackett,1,One,1,The masks I purchased appear to be counterfeit. There was no verification label and the Powercom name was not on the mask as shown in the picture.
25-Mar-21,John Spurlock,5,,0,Great mask.  On FDA and CDC ratings list these masks passed all the testing for kn95's.
6-Mar-21,Joe,1,One,1,The masks I received did not hold up to the water test.  Droplets formed along the seems almost instantly when the mask was filled with water.
20-Oct-20,Raymond Fontes,5,,0,Very comfortable.
4-Mar-21,Brianne Dupuis,1,,0,I can't wear these. The ear loops hurt SO MUCH because they're so small. I really wanted to love these as the mask is great but it makes.my head and jaw hurt for DAYS.

19-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,"I was a little nervous that these masks would be counterfeit as I’ve been reading a lot of articles about counterfeit masks . However, I was able to successfully confirm the numbers on the anti-fake label on the back of the bag and verified that the bag contained genuine masks."
8-Dec-20,Pamela,3,,0,These masks I think are very effective.  Flew from Texas to New Hampshire with no problems.  Had to wear this mask for 6 hours. The only trouble was that the mask came up a little to close to the under eye area. Arrived back healthy.
17-Mar-21,Leslie,5,,0,10/10 would recommend

6-Mar-21,"D.Nitti ""Cojitator""",5,,0,The little bit of extra money well worth the extra protection!  Great value for FDA approved KN95.
15-Feb-21,deborah d borst,5,,0,I feel very protected from airborne droplets when wearing this mask. The value is great compared to other N/K95 masks. My only complaint is that they are tight around my left ear which gets irritated if I'm wearing it a long time.
29-Mar-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,The ear loops are to short. It makes you have monkey ears and the mask crinkles up. Very uncomfortable and the mask keeps popping off my face.
15-Feb-21,William L.,5,,0,Easy to get a snug fit to face

19-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,1,One,1,Tried the water test and it failed so these are fake
4-Dec-20,Sean Wooldridge,5,,0,It doesn't tug on my ears. It isn't flimsy and paper thin like other KNs. I hope these are still around the next time I need a batch.
31-Aug-20,Amazon Customer,5,2,0,The mask fits comfortably over the nose and under the chin.  There is enough room to breathe unlike the N95 which is very tight and not roomy.
2-Sep-20,Susan Nall,1,5,0,They all are entirely too small for any adult. I very disappointed.
20-Mar-21,Gerald Lamont Thomas,5,,0,Safe & security r essential qualities of the product

18-Mar-21,Nichelle J,5,,0,I really like the fit of these masks. They are light weight and fit great to the face for proper coverage. They also don't move around or slip while talking. The ear looks are also comfortable and not irritating after long time wear.
22-Nov-20,KWL,1,,1,They are extremely thin
13-Nov-20,Lola,4,,0,It has some kind of smell.
11-Apr-21,MRB,5,,0,They fit well and seem like the're made of thicker meterial than other KN95 masks I've tried.

25-Jan-21,Benjamin G.,2,One,1,This is my second order of these masks. The elastic ear loops are way too tight. Very very uncomfortable compared to the first order.
2-Feb-21,Amazon Customer,5,,0,Two bands allow for ease of wear.
30-Dec-20,Amy Leigh,5,,0,Perfect. Heightens as you breath in. Definitely good quality!

4-Nov-20,cja80,5,,0,Comfortable and good quality. Good price too.
20-Feb-21,Barbi Boehm,1,,1,This is NOT an actual KN95 mask. I have been an R.N. for 23 years and this most certainly is not a real KN95 mask. It will provide as much protection as a cloth mask. Made in China and not legit. Don't buy!
24-Aug-20,Sandra Smith,4,,0,Very comfortable!!
28-Mar-21,M P,1,,1,I did not receive product shown. The masks have lines of tiny holes that you can see straight through. These are not for Covid-19.
4-Mar-21,theresa desautels,5,,0,"Ear loops could be a little longer so that they don’t pull so tightly.  Other than that, they work perfectly."
24-Feb-21,Therese Kasper,4,,0,Great mask. Gave it 4 stars because can't keep my glasses from fogging up.
26-Dec-20,G. F Jackson,5,,0,"We’ve bought item twice and overall, very happy with purchase! Shipped extremely quickly and seems to be well made. Comfortable to wear and seals well."

14-Feb-21,CD,5,,0,Fits well
21-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,These masks are great! The masks feel a bit tight but it's necessary for optimal fit. Many masks sold online have not been evaluated by the FDA but this brand has and scored exceptional on the testing.
17-Mar-21,Virgil Coleman,4,,0,Good masks
22-Nov-20,Helen E Halchuk,1,,1,This is NOT fda approved  It is made in China.  I did a search to buy a non China made mask and fda approved when I bought this on Amazon.  Amazon needs to change the results.  I have trusted Amazon in the past now I QUESTION AMAZON’s integrity.
1-Aug-20,Laurie Weiner,4,One,0,"Seem like good masks. I have no way of testing to see if really a kn95 quality but thicker and heavier than the "" surgical thickness"" masks you can buy on line. Would rather have noish certified mask but these are nice"
16-Oct-20,Richard Prestia,5,,0,good product
5-Apr-21,SK,4,,0,"The masks are a good fit, but the elastic that goes around the ears is a little to strong. Tends to bend my ears forward. Also no compatible with hearing aids."

5-Nov-20,Carlos Araujo,4,,0,"Fits comfortably . Thick, but not so much that it requires more effort to breathe"
15-Dec-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,Nice and comfortable although not as thick as some of the other brands I have used in the past. Good value for the price. Easy to breathe through and soft on The face.
30-Jan-21,Shawn miller,2,One,0,"This product is apparently intended for children, as the ear straps are not long enough to wear comfortably.  Very disappointing."
21-Aug-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,I’m so happy to finally find certified KN95 masks!
12-Dec-20,Jack,2,,1,This turned out to be only 3 ply. It is clearly not as thick as other KN 95 masks.
8-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,Its giod now
5-Feb-21,Jennifer,5,,0,"It was exactly what I ordered. Small and compact so the mask fits well in pockets and visors. I put one on and attempted to blow out a candle and was unable to do so, proving to me that this is, indeed, a KN95 grade lining"
9-Feb-21,Sharon Reinhold,1,,0,"to small, broke strap,"

9-Apr-21,TJDave,3,,0,Too small for my face.  And nose piece doesn't hold close on the nose.
18-Feb-21,Nirbhay Vohra,4,,0,I mean the ear loops are tight but at least it works. I’m an intern at a clinic and I still haven’t gotten Covid.

17-Jan-21,sookkyungdolney,2,3,1,too thin

31-Jan-21,C. Barr,1,,0,Too tight on my ears. Hard to breathe.
25-Oct-20,Rick Ross,4,,0,This is a thicker KN95 than the others I bought. I am hoping it provides the protection I need in these times. I wear these all the time. I I am trusting that thicker is better.
5-Mar-21,Dina N,5,,0,"Great fit, holds up well"
7-Mar-21,Amazon Customer,3,,1,"Two of the masks came with ear loops on one side only. This lack if quality control makes me wonder about this company's quality control in general. I stapled some elastic tape to the masks to make them work, but still..."
20-Feb-21,MWal,3,,0,"The quality is ok, one did break when I tried to stretch it.  They are a small fit, so I wouldn't recommend these unless your face is petite/xsmall"
22-Nov-20,colette stoneking,1,,0,Difficult to breathe through it and a smell that made me light headed.
31-Mar-21,Rajinder Ghatoaura,5,,0,A bit too tight but good masks.

10-Feb-21,Marva Essick,1,,1,This is NOT an N95 mask. Do not purchase for Covid protection. The name is misleading- KN95. It is purposely misleading and is not returnable. Bad product. Deceptive description.

31-Aug-20,Aurora Ioanid,5,,0,ok
2-Dec-20,Anna Bailey,2,One,0,I cannot wear these because the ear loops are too tight.
15-Sep-20,Elizabeth Beyer,5,,0,This is the best and safest mask one can have.  I have different n95 masks and other kn95 masks and cloth masks.  Pomecom is the most comfortable and is the only kn95 still on the FDA emergency use list as of August.

28-Aug-20,Bri,5,One,0,The quality and comfort were very good. Highly recommend.
29-Oct-20,Miriam Jiggetts,1,,1,VERY VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THESE MASKS. THERE IS NO VISUAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE MASKS HAVE A FILTRATION SYSTEM TO PREVENT AIRBORNE BACTERIA. I EXPECTED THERE TO BE AN INSERT AIRFLOW MECHANISM BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE
19-Mar-21,Patricia payne,5,,0,Good quality

20-Dec-20,sandeep kamath,1,One,1,When I got the first order we were were happy with the quality and the masks had all the information printed  with Green .  However the second order came with Masks with nothing printed on them . Either they were replaced by someone in the supply chain or they outsourced it to someone who probably does not have the required certifications. Returning the second batch . The first one however was amazing .
26-Mar-21,Suzanne Perry PhD,5,,0,Fits very well!
19-Mar-21,Whend,5,,0,Well constructed. Feel safe wearing this mask. Can feel warm if wearing for long periods of time.

25-Oct-20,debbie guerry,5,,0,Comfortable and I feel safe
4-Apr-21,Super Don T,3,,0,"Worked as needed for non- medical mask requirements however, with N95 masks becoming available for retail consumer purchase at the same price point or lower, these KN95 masks are now way overpriced. In addition, the N95s have over the head loops that are way more comfortable than these KN95s over the ears."
14-Jan-21,Carole J Embree,5,,0,"They are most comfortable. I forget I have it on. Strong ear strings, stays clean looking."
17-Feb-21,Jenny Wernick,1,,0,"Works if u have a huge face. It’s a kn95, however it’s too big for my 36 year old face."

6-Feb-21,Susan Duncan,5,,0,Fit well and comfortable.

11-Apr-21,Dawn,5,,0,The fit is wonderful.
10-Mar-21,Sunshine Lover,3,,0,Way too tight for my face.  Also the ear loops are so small and tight that they bend the ear down and slip off.  I gave then to my much younger and smaller hairdresser.
5-Feb-21,Jeanne Bulriss,1,,0,"In the description, it states these will fit adults. Adult what? I have little years and these things fold my ears over and pop off. I'm returning the unopened package."

8-Apr-21,JR,5,,0,My favorite of ALL the masks I’ve used. Made me feel the safest.

3-Sep-20,Nadiyah Omar,4,One,0,Some of the mask came with  just one strap

6-Dec-20,Kathleen Klein,5,,0,"I like the light weight, was able to breathe while being protected."

23-Feb-21,tsands,1,,1,I just opened the mailing envelope and both bags of masks were opened and looked like they'd been gone through.  Counterfeit?
1-Jan-21,D.B. Reed,1,,0,"I haven't used them yet.  I am keeping them for possible "" hot spots"" as a back to my regular masks.  They will definately be used. Thanks!"
6-Mar-21,Auxsender,1,,0,Masks are just sitting in the outer resealable bag. No seals. No tamper proof. How do I know these haven’t been tampered with?  I don’t. No chance I’m wearing these.
4-Feb-21,BW,1,One,1,"Other than the outside packaging , there is nothing to indicated that these mask are KN95. No stamp on mask itself. Also, very thin.  Too important to take a chance!"

22-Mar-21,Marian Hope Finco,1,,0,These masks are too narrow. It pulls my ears and digs into my skin. I think these masks should be sold for children.

12-Sep-20,Roxy,1,60,1,"As can be seen from attached photos, these are absolutely worthless masks with so many little holes & open seems around the nose, mouth, & below bridge of nose where you can see light clearly coming indicating particles could very easily be breathed in through the mask. It’s infuriating to waste so much $$ on masks & have them arrive to realize they’re absolute worthless crap."
29-Jan-21,timwalls2,5,4,0,"These are very comfortable on my face, and the straps are comfortable around the ears. I checked authenticity via scratch off on outer packaging and it checked out to be authentic. I did order from Innovate Tech as suggested by other reviewers. I can breathe easily in these masks. These masks help step up my mask game during these trying times. I would recommend so long as you order from Innovate Tech."
22-Jan-21,Little Louie,4,3,0,"These masks are constructed well from good quality materials and are comfortable to wear for long periods. It has a flexible strip that can be used to crimp to conform to your nose. However, the crimping material does not flex right at the bridge of my nose so some of my breath escapes through the gap to fog up my eyeglasses when I speak or when I exert myself. Yes, I've tried all the defogging tricks and none of them work for me. I just have to shut up and relax more!"
12-Feb-21,alanhouston,5,One,0,Innovate Tech quickly mailed me a ten pack of Powecom KN95 masks.  These are premium quality masks imported by Bonafidemasks to the USA. I ordered these ear loop style masks before I discovered that a head band style KN95 mask is sold by Bonafidemasks directly.  The headband style is more comfortable than ear loops for all day wearing. The Bonafidemasks Powecom KN95 mask folds flat so a ten pack fits in a small desk drawer or even in a large coat pocket. The combination of a Powecom KN95 mask covered with an Old Navy three-ply cotton mask with adjustable ear loops provides maximum protection yet is comfortable for hours of wear.
20-Feb-21,MrsLindasHealthWellness&NaturalCures,3,,1,"When I looked at them, I wasn't sure about the 2 ventilation lines that translucent. I thought they would allow particles in, but after careful consideration and testing the mask.. I didn't notice any air coming through those little vents, because the thing is ...if you can feel air coming through when you breath, there is a more likelihood of saliva particulate/particle being able to come in as well. An frankly, since I used to worked in the medical field, I am very aware of how germs are transmitted. So, I always wear 2 masks no matter what and then some, or maybe a scarf, especially when I travel on buses, just to be sure. But these masks were on the CDC list as well, so that is why I bought them. I also noticed they are just a bit smaller than other masks I have worn, and if you have a large face & or beard, not sure if these would be the best fit. I also noticed they appear to lean more on the paper feel side, rather than like the feel of cotton, with my last brand, which appeared to feel as thought it provided more protection. But overall, these will due for now, or if I'm in a pitch, and need a mask, but again I would wear 2, or along with/combined with another mask just to feel safer. I will definitely be in search of another brand FYI.. it's so hard to find masks that make you feel secure. You have to go through so many before finding the right text & fit.. which is way too time consuming."
13-Feb-21,C. Pinchon,5,,0,I have tried several KN95 masks and try to purchase those listed on the FDA EUA website. These are listed as approved under FDA EUA. I'm a  small-ish Asian woman with smallish features and this mask fits better than other KN95 that I've tried. They are not all the same fit/size. I had to give the other KN95 masks (not FDA approved) to my husband and it fits him well. These Powecom fit very well on my face and don't pull on my ears. It's very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
9-Apr-21,Missy B,5,,0,"Works well for older kid (I have a petite 11 year old girl). I inspected each mask thoroughly and saw ZERO flaws. I am a healthcare worker and take masks seriously, this one met my criteria for a good quality mask. My daughter uses these at school, they are breathable, comfortable, protective, and last with no issues even through her gym class. I did not see a single one tear or disintegrate."
21-Dec-20,AntoinetteC,5,,0,I am so glad I chose this mask. It is much better than many I tired that claimed to be KN95. This one is on the FDA approved list. The company is really supportive and responsive. My 1st shipment was lost and they immediately shipped out a replacement via FedEx. Many days later the 2nd shipment mysteriously arrived. I contacted them to say I would like to pay to keep it but was told to feel free to keep it at no additional charge. Real customer 1st attitude. Happy with the masks. Happy with the service.
18-Oct-20,Chinmaya Prakash,3,One,0,"I suppose any KN 95 these days is a big plus, having tried other this one seems to have one unwanted desire off too many layers coming out on the inside. I initially thought maybe is a problem with only 1. But most of these are not comfortable for reuse. The inside of the masks gets worn out pretty quickly and is not comfortable for re-use. Having used the other KNs they definitely don’t have the same issue as this one upon reuse"
20-Dec-20,Margaret Stringer,5,One,0,"Since masks are the ""in"" thing now, this is one of the more comfortable ones I wore this (2020) year. Fits well around the face. Yes, it fogs my glasses, but not as much as other masks did. I do wear it with around the head extension, as I wear hearing aids, and them, and the mask's straps don't really get along, but the extension is a good solution, even if only homemade."
21-Dec-20,Meryland Cuevas,5,,0,these are super comfortable and seem to be of good quality. I wear them to go to the gym and I can breat well with them since they do not go into my mouth.  The nose part gets tight and secure although you still get some fogging on the glasses with them.  I think they are pretty good for the price as well.
27-Jan-21,Shirley Braun,5,,0,"These are very good masks at a great price.  Saw on the news these ARE on FDA compliant, so they are effective as stated. CDC and Dr Fauci now advise that if you wear a mask OVER this one (paper disposable) you will have the equivalent of medical grade N95"
30-Oct-20,Shaun,5,,0,Let’s give them a real review: I received a pair that was defective product his was no problem . They took care of it. The best customer service five star service . Something Amazon should try finding more companies with.
4-Dec-20,Liana J.,5,One,0,"Don't believe the bad reviews about these being fake or too small. I used the bar code and cross checked it on the Powecom website, and it came up as secure. I even tried to enter it again, and they said it had already had been entered. So that made me feel reassured. They are definitely not too small and could even fit tighter in my opinion. Maybe if you are very overweight or have a very large face, but otherwise they should fit you fine. The masks are very breathable and lightweight, and I feel comfortable wearing them."
1-Dec-20,JC,4,,0,"Sized for smaller oriental heads in width and length.  Thus, not very practical for long term wearing.  Cannot depend on better filtering and breathing ease when wet or sweaty either."
4-Dec-20,Janette Vogel,5,,0,These masks were very comfortable. I do still have issues with my glasses fogging up though. It is nice to not breathe in the mask and be able to speak without mumbling.
11-Dec-20,Debra A.,5,,0,The N95 mask is comfortable  and protective.  This mask is reuseable as long as it is not soiled.  Store in paper bag after use to get it clean. I have bought this product twice.
20-Nov-20,Carmal K.,5,,0,These work really good. Seem to conform around the face and keep air out. But still breathable. Ear straps feel a little long but I have a small face. I tie them in little knots. Works fine. Nose wire comes folded and pointy so takes a little work to bend them to the shape of a nose but otherwise I will buy them again.  They are not itchy either. Love that.
9-Sep-20,KT,5,2,0,The description is as accurate as what I received. I like that fact that the mask is FDA approved (GB2626-2006). The mask were verified as genuine POWECOM product and produced by Guangzhou Powecom Labor Insurance Supply Co Ltd with the anti-counterfeit label.
7-Sep-20,F&BG,5,One,0,Seem well made and thick. I like that they are FDA approved and not some cheap knock that doesn't provide adequate protection.
18-Nov-20,GVegas #1 reviewer,5,,0,They are very comfortable to wear and do not irritate the skin or have issues with breathing.
4-Jan-21,A.D.,2,2,0,These smell awful!!! Like really really awful. Nothing can fix it. Ew.

21-Aug-20,Lori Aguirre,5,,0,"I received my Powecom KN95 Protective Masks today.  Nice snug fit.  This company is on the FDA approved list so they're the real thing!  Can't get it wet or it will destroy the filter but it can be reused.  I'm going to try them out for a week.  If they do well, I'll order some more."

2-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,5,,0,This respirator is comfortable and light. It fits firmly to the face. The elastic bands are very comfortable and don't pull your ears. The nose piece is easily adjustable. I ordered these for more protection when needed since they are FDA approved for use.
29-Oct-20,Nancy,5,,0,Wonderful
12-Feb-21,JetBoy,5,,0,"Soft, ease of use, no slippage from nose. Ear bands are very comfortable on ears."
5-Mar-21,Shah,5,,0,"good quality mask. it fits perfectly on the face, the ribbon is elastic and not too tight..so feels comfortable by the ear."
1-Sep-20,3 Train,5,,0,Received the masks earlier than expected. It was great that the company sent an email with the instructions to verify the authenticity of the masks. The masks were in a sealed package. So far very impressed.
16-Dec-20,Ann carter,5,,0,"Because of the pandemic, we need masks and because they wear out or can be uncomfortable or don't stay in place, these are great. They cover well and dont move around and can breath easily in them. Worth the money !!"

24-Dec-20,Debbie Trad,5,,0,we bought ours masks shipped and sold by amazon.com. we received it in 1 day! I love this mask. I've tried other masks but this ones super comfortable and easy to use. A big plus is that they are on the authorized list which makes these protective. I will purchase again!
12-Feb-21,Dienia,5,,0,Wow this fits my face great a little more room when double masking
7-Mar-21,darling,5,,0,"Very comfortable but, i have to mention the delivery was a nightmare they send my package with ups which. The driver doesn't read the is a sign on the stairs that says ""last name"" packages only, they have to read. know wher, the number are on each side of the doors.i have two entrances and the worse part I was outside he was inside the property he didn't ask for help or any reference. If i was the person he was looking for, why not to ask. He left and and he said he can't delivery the package because no one was there to sign. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, them i have to go and look for my package some place else, because they need signature. I pay to get my delivery at home not to go and find it my self.. Hope they work with more professional people.  Is not the first time this happens to me with others carriers.  Get more Amazon drivers. Besides that the mask are fine. Thank you."

3-Mar-21,Kimberly T.,2,One,1,"We have a different brand of KN95 face masks that fit our faces perfect and our glasses don't get steamed up. This product is not as many layers as we expected, the loops for the ears are too loose and our glasses get very fogged up. Will not purchase again!!!"
