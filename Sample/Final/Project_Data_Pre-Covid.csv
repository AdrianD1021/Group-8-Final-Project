disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,7/21/2019,Pre_Covid,Peggy Wellmon,5,,I got these gloves for me to apply my tanning lotion without getting weird lines on my hands. They are well packaged and only one comes out at a time instead of a clump of them. They are good for the job I wanted them to do. I haven’t broke a single one yet.
disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,3/26/2019,Pre_Covid,DietMJ,5,26,"I needed clear vinyl gloves for a cooking demo.  It's next to impossible to find them in the store- most don't fit well or come in odd colors.  I have small hands (ring size 4-5) and was concerned about the fit.  As some of the other reviews mentioned the gloves run a little small, I ordered size medium.  They were a perfect fit!  Worked well for food prep and held up to normal use.  Will order again whenever this large box runs out."
