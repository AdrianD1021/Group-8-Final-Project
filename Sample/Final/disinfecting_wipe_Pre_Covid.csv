disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,11/12/2018,Pre_Covid,Danielle Herndon,5,One,Always have to have Lysol wipes on hand. I have these on subscription and get a regular delivery of them. So glad I do because I use them for so many things around the house. When you have little ones in school and they're bringing home all kinds of germs and viruses he can't be too careful. these are great for a quick wipe-down of door knobs and light switches and anything else that's touched on a regular basis. They're all so great when cleaning.

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,11/6/2017,Pre_Covid,ClaireElaine,3,6,"Arrived in a very large box with many other items. Something smushed the containers and several of them leaked cleaning fluid all over everything in the box. By the time we got the box, mildew had started to form in the cardboard under one of the Lysol containers. Everything else in the box was small: various makeups which were sealed and fine but slimy, small fidget toys which were not harmed by cleaning fluid, but also a pack of toothbrushes which had the cardboard backing all soaked, so they will need to go through the dishwasher before we put them in our mouths. Lysol is not toothpaste. Lol"

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,11/6/2018,Pre_Covid,C&J,3,,"Canceling my subscription to this item now that they’re sending a larger quantity of smaller containers. The large containers were easy to store (since there aren’t 70 in a pack), and one container lasted a good while. Now that they’ve switched to this smaller container size there are too many containers in one shipment and they’re constantly running out...so I have to stop, got to storage and find a new one, then dispose of the one(s) emptied.  It disrupts the flow of energy and gets annoying,"

This caused the wipes to be kinda dry. It's not the brands fault. It definitely happened during shipping and I'm not sure there's a way to prevent that. So I recommend just buying from the store.

I mean these things don’t last for ever.  I wish they would.  These are so easy to clean with and, safe to use on practically anything. Ok I just cleaned with these.  Yes it took more wipes then normal.  I usually only use these in the bathroom.  I normall uae vinegar and water to clean the house but, saw a lot of bad reviews on here.  So yes I have to agree with others they I will not buying these again.  I bought the Clorox ones on here and, they were awesome.  I think Lysol was not as good anymore or maybe just from Amazon."

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,5/15/2017,Pre_Covid,Daniela,5,92,"Let's face it, cleaning is already a task most of us do not look forward to so why not make it easier? For me, wipes are the answer. Before these I was spraying with a cleaner that was probably spraying in places I didn't want it to, waiting for the cleaner to soak in before using paper towels to finally wipe off the food particles and spills. Now I simply grab a wipe out of the container and everything comes off in one step and I can clean with the wipe exactly where I want to, unlike a spray. The packaging makes it easy to tear off one or as many as you need and closes tightly. These work better to really help loosen and remove any stuck on food that I would usually have to scrub off with other cleaning products. I should also mention I used to buy Clorox wipes but these leave less lint than the Clorox did. I would have to wipe the lint away with a rag after cleaning with those, not saving me any time. These Lysol wipes work great, one goes a long way and they arrived in perfect condition. I'll be buying for life (until one day when I hopefully become rich and can afford a great housekeeper, that is.)"

I end up using a few for some purposes that I thought were going to be a one and done deal. I like the scent and it takes off the gross brown stuff that's under the rim of the stove burners. It won't take off a wine stain on the cheap counters at my apartment, I still have to break out spot cleaner for that. I switch out between these, Clorox and Wegmans brands and they are all pretty comparable."

All the paper wrapping had to be peeled off and wiped down after I unwrapped it. The good thing was that there wasn't anything else in the box this time. These wipes are very nice to have for quick cleanups."

Because of the wrappers on all of the cylinders was deteriorating and smelled strongly of bleach stinging the skin when touched. I have recently become accustomed to using disinfectant wipes to clean kitchens/bathroom/any surface, but this has completely soured my experience of Lysol. Since the plastic wrapper was not punctured I know this was not a fault in shipping, but instead on the factory side. I will be using competitors wipes from here out, and would strongly recommend any other disinfectant wipe consumers to do the same."

It shows that it will be in a plastic can but what I received definitely wasn’t in a plastic can. It’s in a bag form instead where you open the plastic lid attached to the bag and pull out a wipe. Similar to like baby wipe packaging and one can easily get them mixed up which is why I liked the cans better. It’s not worth the trouble for me to go and return them though. They should update the image to this product so that they’re not tricking customers regarding what they will receive.

My Mom lives in a very remote area and has cancer.  She needs this but her white blood cell count is too low for her to get out in public to purchase items or take the damaged items back to be returned and needed to start using them immediately.  She doesn't have internet and I live in another state.  I tried to let Amazon know this but what I found access to is a return.  Since she needed it immediately, started to use the first one.

However, had it not been for the extra fourth container, I'd probably purchase Clorox instead. These wipes seem slightly thinner than the Clorox ones. And the packaging was horrendous. Something had to have busted or leaked at some point during the shipping process because when I opened the shrink wrap that was over all 4 containers, it ripped off all the slightly damp labels. Not a terribly big deal since having a container sans label makes no difference to the product itself, but it did have me a little perplexed and concerned as to why each bottle's label was already damp in the first place. Again, nothing wrong with the product itself, but in terms of packaging, or perhaps Amazon shipping, I'd give it maybe 2 stars."
