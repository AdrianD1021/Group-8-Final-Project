2000,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,30-May-20,G550,1,863,"While I do believe this is real germ-x, it is not like any other germ-x I have bought. It is extremely watery. If you look at the inactive ingredients you will see that water is the first ingredient (ingredients are listed in order of volume in products) on the older bottle I have bought a few months ago, water is the last inactive ingredient. No wonder this was inexpensive, it is watered down by the manufacturer. Wish I could return it. (New bottle is on the left in the picture, old bottle on the right)"
2001,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,28-Apr-20,Maria,5,258,"This is a listing for legitimate Germ X made by the actual manufacturer and distributed by Amazon. I was in shock that I got an order of it successfully during this time. It arrived 3 weeks earlier than expected. It is 4 large bottles. I ordered universal pumps for 32oz bottles to use with these bottles. If/when this listing becomes available, trust that you are buying the actual product."
2002,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,22-May-20,hollyjj,5,240,"***** UPDATE******  Hi Y'all!  I wanted to give some updated information to my review below.  I ordered a second batch of this, and it was different.  The cap was mint green (not white), and the label was crooked.  The amount of alcohol is different (62% on the mint green cap, and 63% on the white cap).  So.......I called the manufacturer, VIJON, and left a message.  I thought I'd never hear anything, and the sweetest lady called me back in about 3 hours.  She had me read the batch numbers on both bottles, and said they are both legit.  She said they ran out of white caps, and had to switch to green caps.  She said they are producing hand sanitizer about 24 hours a day, and they are getting them out as fast as they can, so the labels are not perfect.  She also said they do make different formulas of their product, and the difference in alcohol percentage was normal. So I still don't think any of these are fake as long as you bought them from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller.  Hope that helps! I am shocked to see all the folks claiming this is fake.  I do agree the bottles weren't quite as full as I thought they should be, but we should have been paying $24 for this, rather than $18, so I wonder if a machine malfunctioned and didn't fill to the top, and they took that into consideration?? Amazon maybe got a special deal on them?  Mine were sold and shipped from Amazon, and not a 3rd party seller.  Anyway....I don't agree these are fake.  The bottles look fine, labels look legit, product inside seems fine, and smells good.  It's a strong scent of alcohol, but on my hands, I can smell the aloe!  I snagged several orders of these for myself, friends, neighbors, and our office.  Every order I got was the same, and I am pleased.  Especially since they were less than $5 a bottle!"
2003,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,30-Apr-20,Jennifer Mitchell,3,128,I don't usually write reviews.  I am grateful for the product itself however this is NOT actual Germ-x.  The bottles arrived opened not sealed.  They are not actually filled all the way.  The sanitizer is quite runny.  I will not buy from this seller again.
2004,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,13-May-20,BabyA,5,128,"I can't believe that people are REALLY claiming the authenticity of this Germ-X. The price is absolutely wonderful and great in a time of need to keep around. As a big germaphobe already, I have used Germ-X for years. I did receive one bottle with the top squished and I lost a small amount of sanitizer, which was probably due to poor package handling. The bottles were not sealed but lids tightly screwed and this is normal, even when bought at Walmart they aren't sealed. My bottles weren't filled to the top but no sanitizer I've ever bought has been filled to the top.. The scent is light, sanitizer isn't sticky and provides you with the coverage you need to keep your hands germ free. If you haven't used Germ-X as a child in school or as an adult in your everyday routine, you'll be naive to others claims. And unless your bottle is turned upside down in the box, even with improper package handling, it isn't possible that every last ounce was emptied out. If you still aren't convinced, if you have it and don't believe it's real then just take a sniff and you'll quickly smell the alcohol. It is the regular consistency of hand sanitizer as well."
2005,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,14-Aug-20,Kas 2156,5,91,"This product shipped promptly. I read reviews and got nervous about the authenticity. Called as soon as I have the lady the batch number she told me the bottle size and percent Alcohol. She also said the formula is different from old bottles but it is a genuine product. I went to a ""germX"" website and asked her she said it's a third party site so they don't have anything to do with it listing the old formula in the ingredients. Let's all relax the system still works. GermX customer service was great but I felt stupid for calling, it's real. To address the bottles being sealed.... Never have I bought germX at Walmart and the bottle was sealed, people are just paying attention now when they were oblivious before. Hope this helps."
2006,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-May-20,Mr Brock bro gamer Suss,5,74,"A lot of reviewers  have made comments about the authenticity of this item. Mine arrived in an Amazon box and inside was a sealed box from the manufacturer, Germ X.  No issues, no leaking, no half empty bottles, or spilling of product. If you are able to order this product I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate, it will probably come before your promised time frame. It‚Äôs a great deal. I will be using liter pumps  to dispense."
2007,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,27-Apr-20,Amazon Customer,5,61,"This is great Sanitizer of high quality to get in such crisis, specially brands like Purell or Germx. I would like to thanks Amazon for speedy delivery. Highly recommended."
2008,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,10-May-20,Stephanie Todd,1,53,"Buyer be ware. I was excited to order these on Amazon and at a reasonable price during this time. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The bottle caps were all loose, old gummy ‚Äúsanitizer‚Äù on the side of the caps, all bottles were various levels and clearly not the real germ-x sanitizer. I don‚Äôt know what is truly in the bottles. Out of precaution, I had to throw them away as I did not trust what was inside the bottles."
2009,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,4-May-20,A,1,49,"Is this real? None of the bottles came with a seal, so I have a feeling it is a fake product :("
2010,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-May-20,J. Lillard,1,46,I did not like that 1 bottle came almost empty. No cracks or holes in bottle or box just empty. So bizarre üëéüèº
2011,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,13-May-20,johnandstaci,1,42,"Bottles are not sealed, different volumes of liquid, labels on the bottle not is same place."
2012,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,15-May-20,Amazon Customer,1,34,Bottlles are not sealed and are damaged. Caps not all the way screwed tight and spilled in the box. I waited almost a month to receive it. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied. Strange thing it doesn't even smell like germ-x hand sanitizer.
2013,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,7-May-20,Yolanda,1,32,This product came with no safety seal and it wasn't full. I dont feel this is real Germ-X. Beware!!!!
2014,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,16-May-20,Candy C,5,25,"Wow... I am so thankful I was finally able to get sanitizer. Just like another reviewer I was doubting if it was going to come at all. Ordered 4/22 Deliver today 5/16. So it took a while but considering the situation I can‚Äôt complain. My bottles were not broken nor half empty, packaging was well done. A smaller box fully taped inside a bigger amazon box. One had a few ounces missing but again I will not complain. The price was just phenomenal less than $20 for all! I feel like I won the jackpot. As far as the smell I actually like it. So definitely 2 thumbs up in general."
2015,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,12-May-20,Flameheart,5,21,"This is legit! This is the real stuff! I don‚Äôt know why the other reviews say otherwise, but the ones I received were authentic! Like what the other review said, mine also came in Amazon box and in it is the sealed box of the sanitizers directly from Germ-X manufacturer. There were no damage in the product at all, no leaks or damaged bottles. I will buy again if it becomes available!"
2016,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,22-Sep-20,LIZY,1,19,OPEN IT AND IT WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.. THIS WAS A CHEAP HAND SANITIZER PUT INTO THE BOTTLE.. BUYER BEWARE.. NOW YOUR PRODUCTS.
2017,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,26-Apr-20,Dana,5,21,Arrived early!
2018,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,29-May-20,hballparks,1,20,I don't usually write reviews. I am grateful for the product itself however this is NOT actual Germ-x. The bottles arrived opened not sealed. They are not actually filled all the way. The sanitizer is quite runny and smells nothing like the bottle I currently have from Walgreens. Labeling on bottles are askew and lids keep popping off because they do not fit.  Will be returning as a have no idea what's in the bottles.
2019,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,22-Sep-20,CiCiBaby,1,18,"There's no way this is genuine Germ-X. It smells terrible, like rancid sanitizer. Bleh!"
2020,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,14-May-20,jc,5,11,"Ordered 4/21, didn't ship until 5/12 and arrived in 2 day prime shipping. THIS IS FOR THE SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON. If you bought this from Amazon as the seller and it came with a smaller Germ-X manufacturer sealed labelled box containing all 4 bottles, YOU'RE GOOD. It's the real deal. All bottles were filled level and even, exp dates (2022) and labels were all stamped uniform, there were some air bubbles present with the labeling, but that's normal. Smells awful but that's hand sanitizer. There's no plastic safety wrap or inner seal, so for those who got (double) crushed boxes, peeling labels, leaky uneven bottles, I don't know who you can blame. Imagine trying to buy this in store then where anything can be easily tampered then? I don't remember anything having seals. I'm very happy with this purchase, now to find some pumps and mini bottles."
2021,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,22-Aug-20,Dana Larabell,1,16,I was supposed to get 24 Germ-X hand sanitizers and only received 20. I ordered these for our Cross Country Team and now I don‚Äôt have enough for each runner.
2022,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,23-Sep-20,Adam,1,15,"This is clearly counterfeit, smells odd and bottle caps don't even match the bottles appropriately. I cannot trust that the correct alcohol was used to create this, so I'm forced to get a refund from Amazon and throw the product in the garbage since it is not returnable."
2023,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,20-May-20,Sarah,1,17,"First off, I only received 3 bottles not 4. All of the bottles were open, leaking, and caked in dirt. There is even what I‚Äôm assuming is dirt floating in one of the bottles. I highly doubt this is actual germx. This is not returnable and getting a refund looks impossible. Do not buy into this SCAM."
2024,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,22-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,1,16,This is not real GermX. It smells like a really bad cheap perfume. It‚Äôs just terrible. And they do not allow returns.
2025,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,28-Jun-20,C.H. Vig,1,16,"I wish I could NOT give a star... Total disappointment!!!!! Just arrived today and I was so excited, as the package arrived 2 weeks before it was supposed to. Then the disappointment set in after opening the box, I could see right away that these 4 bottles are NOT the normal Germ-X I have bought in the stores before the crisis.  They were watery and the smell is different compared to the ones I just had bought at a well-known grocery store a few weeks ago. Now I'm out of the $$ as you cannot return this item due safety reasons, flammable, etc (but they can be delivered... ??).  How can I be confident that my order is safe to use?  There was NO seals on any of the bottles and the caps were barely on there, this just DOES NOT look nor smell the same as of other bottles of Germ-X I have.  I will not be using this crap on my hands, just can't trust what may be in these bottles.  With all the news media showing certain companies/brands adding methanol, who can trust that is not in these?  AGAIN, NO SEALS ON BOTTLES. It's just NOT worth the risk. Now just one more unknown product going into our landfills."
2026,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,24-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,1,15,This is not the real Germ-X.  This product stinks and  I would not recommend it to anyone.
2027,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,20-Sep-20,Claudia,1,14,"FAKE. Do not purchase. It is not the original GermX Hand sanitizer. FAKE. FAKE. FAKE. The will ship to you no problem, but will not allow to return because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúflammable product. FAKE PRODUCT!"
2028,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,25-Jun-20,drealeah,3,10,"I‚Äôve read all the bad reviews and want to chime in. Yes; this hand sanitizer is watery compared to precious Germ X. Mine also didn‚Äôt come with a seal under the cap (clear cap). It also doesn‚Äôt smell amazing at all. However, I SO want it to be legit so I called the customer complaint line from the back of the label. Based on the lot number, they were able to verify my product, they knew the expire date (which matches the bottles). They explained that they have two ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù formulas and this one is simply different ingredients but equally effective. Anyway, I feel better now, but def agree it arrives looking a little suspect."
2029,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,16-May-20,Amazon Customer,2,16,"Out of the four bottles contained in this pack, two of them were broken and leaking when I received them today. The system won‚Äôt let me ask for a replacement either."

2031,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,18-May-20,Cynthia G.,5,8,"After reading the reviews of spilled and possibly fake contents, I was pretty worried about what I would get.  I received my order today (after waiting nearly a month), and it's for real.  The bottles came in a sealed Germ X box, and there was no leakage.  They are flip tops, and the bottle are not sealed, but they aren't sealed if you find them on a store shelf either.  My cousin got a 32-ounce bottle at Target, and he verified that.  The bottles held slightly different amounts, but the one with the least fluid had as much as the picture my cousin sent.  Also, I had talked to Vi-Jon the manufacturer, when I saw the review, and the person told me to look for a seven-digit batch number in black. probably starting with ""04,"" followed by the expiration date, and all the bottles had that.  They are all from the same batch.  It feels fine and smells good.  So, after all that, I'm very satisfied and these bottles will last me for a very long time."
2032,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,16-May-20,Kim Usher,1,13,All 4 bottles were open and wasting out. How?! Very disappointed in this after waiting a month for this.
2033,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,27-Apr-20,tammy2471,5,8,"Product was delivered earlier than expected. Product is exactly as described. I'm very happy with this purchase considering how hard it is getting hand santizer,and the price is grrreat! Thank you Amazon! This will last my family awhile as I have older parents that really need this!"
2034,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,23-Sep-20,Christopher Suer,1,13,Definitely not germ x hand sanitizer. Smells completely different.
2035,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,28-May-20,Secanda Jewell,5,5,"Delivery was expected by June 1, 2020. It was delivered May 24, 2020. Such a pleasant surprise. From the other reviewers, I was prepared for some missing volume but even if I received 96/128 oz. for less than $20, I would be thrilled. No problems at all, I received all 128 oz. I even had a foil seal under the plastic cap. It smells a little alcohol-y, but some sanitizers always did. I was using 91% alcohol anyway. It seems a little watery, but I've been using liquid (not gel) sanitizer and alcohol in spray bottles. Is it real Germ-X? I don't care, I have been buying sanitizer from distilleries for $40/gallon. It was extra for gel. People were selling expired sanitizer, so there's that. Things that may be a deterrent for some didn't matter to me. Fast shipping, No leaks. Good price. Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
2036,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,13-Jul-20,Courtney C.,1,8,"I guess Germ-X just isn‚Äôt what it used to be. It was really runny- not the gel Sanitizer I remember using pre-Covid.. and it has a really strong scent. Definitely not ‚Äúunscented‚Äù! I wish it was just an alcohol scent to it! It smells rotten and lingers on my hands. The only good thing I can say about it is that while it was sliding through my hands like water since it‚Äôs more like a turning a 2 liter of coke up than a gel hand sanitizer to get a glob out into your palm!!!- it did sting a paper cut on the underside of my hand! So it should do the job if you can manage to get it on every side of your hands and leave it that for a few seconds to do its thing! Really disappointed! I know like everyone else that ordered this, I was SO disappointed that this wasn‚Äôt the real thing! After months of hunting for the name brand we are accustomed to and it being sold out and hoarded by selfish people- I was excited to get a few bottles to have to give to my kids‚Äô teachers in August, family members, friends, and bus drivers! People who would need something that would STICK! Not this stuff that slips right though your fingers and smells like *censored because you wouldn‚Äôt post this review if I told you how it really smelled!!!* Sick of 2020 being the year of lies and being taken advantage of at every single turn! Shame on your amazon and YOU TOO GERM-X! I‚Äôd return it but all the other hand sanitizer is just as awful and at this point, I have to make do with something awful. Next time, I‚Äôll buy the one that starts with a P and PRAY that company is honest on Amazon!"
2037,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,14-May-20,S. Fuentes,2,9,"I was thankful that I was able to find this product for my father, sister, daughter and myself. The delivery was perfect, so that was great. However, all except for two bottles were missing at least 1 inch of sanitizer. It appears as if someone took some from each bottle. There was no protective foil lining the bottle opening, so this was easy to do."
2038,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,23-Sep-20,Ciera,2,11,Product arrived in good shape but the smell is horrible.
2039,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,4-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,1,10,Most of the bottle tops were lose and leaking. I paid a lot for these because my son needed them for school. He will not be able to use them as they will leak all over his back pack and gym bag.
2040,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,29-May-20,MiMi,1,8,"This is  NOT an authentic product. My package arrived ysterday (05/28/2020) and the bottles were NOT equally full. Two of them were not level the same as the other two. The consistency was NOT gel as the original GermX . The smell was NOT the same, even the tops/caps were a different color than the original GermX . GermX has a unique fragrance and this was NOT it. I didn't dare to put it on my hands. DO NOT BUY! By the way, IT IS NOT REFUNDABLE. Save your hard earn money $$$"

2042,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,5-Jul-20,Jose,1,7,"I have purchased multiple Germ-X with amazon since the pandemic started. And I always check it to see the quality. Never have I been disappointed. This is the only brand that I love the formula, how it feels and the smell. We all know that Germ-X scent. UNTIL now. I received the 32oz bottle July 5th and immediately I knew something was wrong, it flows like water!!! Not thick at all. And the smell.. cheap tequila!! NOT GERM-X formula at all!! I‚Äôm so disappointed on the quality. When you put it on, it doesn‚Äôt feel like gel, feels like water!! If I had ordered hand sanitizer from another brand and this is what I got, I wouldn‚Äôt care because i know it‚Äôs gonna be different. But this feels extremely cheap and ripped off. I bought the brand Germ-X for a reason. I know what I want, so I‚Äôm paying for that brand."
2043,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,7-Jul-20,J. Robles,2,6,"I bought two orders of these 32oz 4pk GermX. The first time I bought it, the product was perfect. It smelled just like the small bottle of GermX I bought at Target. So weeks later I decided to order another set to give out to family, but these bottles did not smell good at all. It smelled like cheap vodka gone bad! As far as the consistency of the product, it is very watery and not gel like. I actually found the same product at Target and the consistency was the same like these bottles from Amazon, very watery. I wish I could return the second set I bought because the smell is truly horrible, and I don‚Äôt think anyone would want that smell on their hands. It seems like the manufacturer of this product is cutting corners in order to mass produce. They are reducing the amount of gel that is normally put in the product, and they‚Äôre not adding any fragrance, which leads people to believe they‚Äôre getting fake GermX. I honestly won‚Äôt be buying this product/brand ever again and hopefully Purell becomes available soon."

2045,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,6-May-20,Amazon Customer,2,9,I'm a little concerned if this is actual hand sanitizer by Germ X in the bottles. None of the bottles were sealed. Some had more liquid than others. And one was spilling in the box? I'm pretty sure there should have been a seal on top of the bottles under the cap and I don't feel so safe using it.
2046,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,20-Mar-21,Elena Rosas,1,3,"Purchased the 12 pack of 10 Oz bottles. They were packed well. That is why I gave it one star. I noticed that none of the bottles had a foil seal, not really sure if any of the ones I purchase at the store have them but it definitely caught my attention. One bottle was only half full and the cap was barely on the bottle. I used a tiny amount to try it out and oh my goodness if I had an appetite let's say I wouldn't have had one after smelling the sanitizer. It smells like a mix of baby vomit, baby poop, a hint of a multipurpose flowery scented cleaning solution, a retirement home or cheap motel, and air freshener sprayed into the air after someone has taken a massive dump and tried to mask the scent. I added 91% isopropyl alcohol to the bottle that was half filled and it barely reduced the scent of the very detailed mixture of scents I described. I hate having to return items especially by shipping soooooo I guess I'll be transferring them into different bottles where I can add more isopropyl alcohol. Do yourself a favor, just go to your local pharmacy or department store and purchase what you know works and doesn't wreak so bad"
2047,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-Oct-20,Amazon Customer,1,3,"Im very skeptical these days - with Covid and the recent ""fake and dangerous"" hand sanitizer scare. Now, I don't know that there is anything wrong with this but it certainly has me concerned fr a few reasons: 1) the box was damaged and had no safety seals - just tape 2) the bottles are all filled to different levels - also no safety seals and screw tops were loose 3) one bottle was leaking from loose top - It just seems obvious that these were not filled in a factory setting and that they were filled an assembled by hand - This may not indicate a problem but it does raise an eyebrow - Please do better thx"
2048,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,26-Jun-20,Renae,4,6,It seems as the real deal so no complaints about that.. The seal was missing in each bottle which do have me concern.. I have always used germ-x since I had have grandkids hopefully it's just a safe as the germ-x I have purchased from store
2049,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,19-May-20,Mar-52,5,4,"Short of waiting a bit for delivery (19 days), everything about this purchase was perfect. Product is authentic, delivered undamaged, bottles are full with no leakage, and last but not least,.........the price for the quantity is great. This will keep me for a good length of time, and I can even give away a bottle or two to friends that need it."
2050,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-Aug-20,J...,4,One,"The price that I paid on Amazon for four 32 ounce bottles of hand sanitizer from a well-known manufacturer is pretty terrific. It sells out fast and I had to check back often to get an order placed. The version that I received is 62% ethyl alcohol, so it meets CDC requirements for ethyl alcohol based hand sanitizer. The good news is it doesn't smell awful - it's almost kind of pleasant with just a very mild alcohol aroma. I've purchased other hand sanitizers made with ethyl alcohol/ethanol and they've smelled strongly like cheap tequila, so it's a relief that this product has a non-offensive scent. While technically a gel, it's somewhat thin and runny. The consistency is okay once you know what to expect - just rub it in quickly so none drips off. After it dries, there's no stickiness and perhaps there's a plus for not being a thicker gel. The expiration date is just under 2 years from now, so no worries about aging out before using it all up. Delivery was much sooner than the original estimated date, like a couple weeks sooner. The bad news is my shipment leaked, like many other reviewers have noted. One of the four bottles had a faulty flip top - had a hole in it directly over the little pour spout. The bottle lost about 15% of its contents. I opened the box within a couple hours after delivery, so maybe I'm lucky that I got to it before more leaked out. The other three bottles were fine. If you order, just make sure to check for any leakage promptly upon delivery."

I specifically bought this product because the GermX scent is ore pleasant than other sanitizers... every single bottle I received smelled like a cheap tequila. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Will not order again.
2052,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,9-Jul-20,MelEmme8,1,5,I rarely leave reviews. But this one needs to be done. I purchased this over a month ago and figured and received it yesterday. I expected the delay and that was fine. Two bottles had leaked all over the box. The other two had lids that were barely on. I can deal with that. It happens. But the smell is ATROCIOUS! My kids refuse to have it on their hands. It made one of them gag. I can't place the smell but it's not alcohol and definitely does not smell like other bottles I have around the house. There is also a very sticky feel to the gel. I had to wash my hands after using it because the stickiness would not go away. Now I'm stuck with a 4 pack that I was going to use to fill up the kid's small bottles they keep at school. I have to donate a product such as this. Don't want anyone else using it!

Some complained it did not have a seal but when I bought these bottles at Walmart and Dollar Tree it did not come with a seal either. Also, if you have any papercuts and use this hand sanitizer you will definitely know it has alcohol. Delivery time was two weeks, which was reasonable for this current time."

I like that it typically has light unnoticeable scent.  I found these on sale so I decided to buy them.  I got them today and the scent is horrible and smells like cheap restaurant hand soap and the fragrance will remain on your hands for awhile after using.  I tried to return them but unfortunately you are not able to return them.  If you are sensitive too smell I would recommend avoiding these and just buying GermX from the store.

You'll get 4x 32 fl oz bottles with a lot missing.  They were placed in a box (none seemed to be spilled inside), but 3 out of 4 bottles were squeezed and dented.  Either this was accidental or an attempt to make it look like the bottles were more full than they were. Whether there's some conspiracy to screw me out of product or not, bottom line, I was screwed out of product.  I filled 3 of the bottles up with one of the others to make it easier to see how much you should have VS how much you're getting ripped off.  Up to you whether they're worth buying or not, but know they're not packaged with plastic seals and they'll be missing product, whether they spill in the box or not."

After shipping the box move left to right all the time, the inside gel comes out everywhere inside the deliver box making a big mess almost every time because the bottle caps were all loose or off the bottles. This is an easy fix that the vendor just needs to make sure the cap is sealed and tight all the way. Hope the vendor will take care of it in the future."

I do not think Amazon would take any risk of selling a fake product, i personally dont think its worth it... Yes we are in a pandemic and these are high demand items so the company may cut back on something that they may feel is safe to do in order to make sure its enough to go around rather than not enough at all... I purchased Clorox Germicide from Home Depot and received different labels but i check it and its the same product... A bunch of over grown folks pouting like we are all perfect or you too good for the product... Grow up... Its not fake, maybe watery but repeat not fake"

If you smell straight from the big bottle it doesn't smell the greatest however when it's on my hand I dont notice an overwhelming smell. Doesn't leave hands sticky like.some other brands which I love. Great price to refill bottle at home and to send to school with kids."

Im so glad I did, since my work reopened in early May and we could not source any hand sanitizer from the usual corporate options. This supply refilled our bottles at work stations and more. I lucked out and was able to purchase a second time, so we had some future refills. This IS the genuine GermX product, despite what some other reviews state, and has helped us tremendously at our doctor's office. The shipping was super fast; though I was thinking it was going to be 3 weeks, it wound up being only a week."

When I received the product I could smell the Germ X before I opened the box. The second box was intact, but the first box that the product was in, had 2 of the bottles damaged at the top which allowed some of the Germ X to escape and spill into the box. Gladly I had just finished a large bottle of sanitizer and was able to pour what was left of the 2 damaged bottles in another bottle.  I was only offered to return the Germ X not to replace it.  Too missy to return."

Purchased a smaller bottle from target to compare. Same thing. It is legit and original Germ X. The reason why the consistency and thickness isn‚Äôt the same is because there is a severe shortage of ingredients used to manufacture this product. Seeing as most of the ingredients for Clorox wipes, hand sanitizers, Lysol sprays and all the other high demand items are from overseas quality of product isn‚Äôt the same.

Case / box is then placed in an oversized cardboard box with some few packing pillows to fill remaining space and NO INDICATION of which end needs to be up. Summary of the four bottles I received follows : 1 full bottle (cap secure) ... 1 bottle 15/16 full (cap no longer clicked fully closed) ... 1 bottle 7/8 full (cap no longer clicked fully closed) & 1 bottle approx 2/3 full (cap completely flipped fully open and ready to dispense). The remaining 10 to 12 ounces of the product coated the interior of the inner box and the outer surfaces of the bottles with the jelly like goo beginning to dissolve the adhesive holding the bottle labels in place. On a positive note the inner cardboard box with it's liberal coating of sanitizer is now 100% COVID protected .. Me ? not so much now.

Sanitizer is much more watery than others, which is not a problem and it is not sticky like others.  Definitely smell the alcohol in the product, but has not other smell.  Product does meet my family needs.  Packing is horrible as many others have commented on for this product type-4 large bottles in one box.  All for caps were loose in the box and product seeped out from all four bottles.  About one inch from each bottle.  Other vendors who I received similar products put tape around caps to ensure no opening during transit.  Beware, you may be one of the unlucky purchasers, like many whose product will be inside the contents of the box.  Product is double mixed boxed, however this does not help leakage."

It can be used to refill smaller pump bottles or refill pocket size bottles. Seems less expensive to buy these big bottle to refill your smaller bottles. I guess you could use these big bottles on a larger scale if you really big hands. Smells like, um, Germ-X. So, no surprise there. It is a clear gel type liquid, which would be expected if you have ever used Germ-X. As the label says, it is for hands, so don't do stupid stuff and use it all over your body. I have a feeling that may not end well. If you get it in your eyes it is irritating, so use it only as directed by the manufacturer. READ THE LABEL. And hey, go to their website and read up on it if you are the type of person to use things in ways they are not intended."

After two weeks, the liquid level became different in different bottles. I unscrewd the cap, found there are no that additional layer of seal, that you need to break before first time use.

When comparing consistency, smell, ingredients and the fine print, I saw some discrepancies between store bought germ-x versus the amazon purchased ones. Store bought germ x has a very nice pleasant smell. Amazon's has a pungent alcohol smell and not at all pleasant. Store bought say 63% alcohol versus Amazon's 62%. Shouldn't the same brand be consistent all around? Even the typing was a bit off, such as the order of the inactive ingredients and using the symbol '&' in Amazon's product versus AND in the store bought. I'm more than certain these are counterfeit but not worth the trouble to return. As far as the 5-star reviews...I don't know..seems very suspect to me. But if it's safe hand sanitizer, I guess it's worth the cost, but it's definitely not the real deal. Buyer beware!"

First, one bottle was short filled- a quality control that wouldn't have gotten by an authentic production facility.  Second, I opened the cap and the liquid inside smelled like a rancid sewer.  Either Germ X sold a bad batch or someone substituted the good stuff with fake stuff at the Amazon distribution center. I have a bottle of real Germ X that smells right and feels right to compare it to."

Germ-X to me seems like the same quality and I used it to refill Purell pump bottlesdoes it .  It works just the same and more importantly is does not have any nasty odors. Some industrial sanitizers like they have in offices or public spaces have a nasty odor that smell like a full garbage truck on a hot summer day.

Some of the bottles in the box packaged by Germ-x (NOT the Amazon packaging) had very loose caps that I had to tighten after I took them out.

So, when I saw this offer at a reasonable price, I  jumped at it. I'll use it but I was disappointed.  The alcohol smell is simply overwhelming and it is pure liquid with a watery consistency, not remotely gel like. It just runs off your hands if you aren't very careful when you pour it out of the bottle. If the smell is any indication, it does indeed have the stated alchohol content in it and should kill germs effectively.  Since that's the ultimate point,  I suppose it'll get the job done but I'm not thrilled.  I can't wait until I can get my hands on some Germ-X  Gel Sanitizer with Aloe but who knows how long it will be until that's available again."

Don't buy this , if you even go to Germ-x's site, they don't even show this bottle type or the scent.  It seems either this was counterfit or something went bad in terms of the sanitizer or the scent. I just wasted $40 and not the manufacturer or Amazon doesn't care.  It seems I'll need to start taking up to the BBB board on both Amazon and Germ-x and Vijon about this issue.  This product really induced a nauseous feeling ,and it lingers. DO NOT BUY i REPEAT DO NOT BUY - BUY THE OTHER SIZES - at least they are NOT cherry (bought 4x32oz and they were OK)"

Top and parts of bottom of box were wet where it had leaked everywhere.  Also, this sanitizer is much more ""runny"" and not as thick as the sanitizer used to be. I'm guessing because of the backlog and maybe trying to save costs, I don't know. Price was great and it took about 2 weeks to get, but that was expected."

Then, I noticed that these seemed kind of watery and I glanced at another review that pointed out the main inactive ingredient was water. I confirmed tat on mine. The main INACTIVE ingredient is water. I've never seen GermX be this watery before. I've always seen if have a gel-type of consistency, not watery. I would not but these again.

The price was also fair given the shortage and demand these days. The only complaint that I had, and echoed by others in the reviews, is that apparently some slight amount leaked out in transit, so packaging could be better. We're talking way under 10% so it's not a dealbreaker and worth sending back, but just a slight annoyance. Would still recommend at a reasonable price."

While real Germ X has a very clean smell, the other product smells like rotten liquor.  As much as I wanted this sanitizer to be real, it isn't.

Although I'm grateful to have it, the odor is so off putting I think I'd rather donate it than use it myself. In addition it makes me wonder if this is some other hand sanitizer (likely one that we were warned to not buy due to the addition of menthol) and that's why it smells so GOD DAMN HORRIBLE.

It's runny like some of the off-brands I've bought over the past 3 or 4 months. Maybe that's just the way it's being made these days, I don't know. However, my very first thoughts was that it had been ""watered"" down, although I know that actual water could not be used for that purpose in this product. I'm going to buy a small bottle the next time local stores has it to compare the thickness. If there is a difference I intend to come back here and update my review."

I purchase the Germ X brand and so far we are satisfied with the product. This bundle, when I purchased it, was at an excellent purchase price. It's not as pleasant smelling as the  Purell brand with Aloe I usually purchase but it does do the job at killing the germs. At this time of everyone needing to be very protective and doing our part with not spreading germs, having a trusted brand like Germ X is a major plus."

It doesn't appear that the box was opened previously (no damage to cardboard, no second layer of tape, etc). Of the three bottles, there were two different ""recipes"" of hand sanitizer (labels indicate slightly different compositions). Two of the bottles contained sanitizer that is more watery, smells more strongly of alcohol, and were not completely full. The caps on those two was also significantly ""looser"" than the third bottle, so I am a bit concerned that the lower level of sanitizer may reflect that some of the alcohol has already evaporated out. The third bottle is closer to the product I was hoping to receive (less watery, less smell, and full bottle) with all bottles. Amazon support resolved this to my satisfaction, so overall I am reasonably satisfied with the product delivered under the circumstances, but not entirely happy. The lack of the fourth bottle is a longer term inconvenience and the inconsistency of receiving two different formulations in the same box feels odd as a consumer."

I bought a pineapple scent to add to it expecting that the scent wouldn‚Äôt be super pleasant. But I also didn‚Äôt expect it to be as viscous as water. If you can find something else in store do it.

The bottles were not sealed (but none of any sanitizers I have bought were sealed either). The caps were slightly loose but not enough to allow spilling of content. I compared the consistency and feel/smell to other hand sanitizers I had in the house and it was spot on in every aspect except the Germ -X was ever so slightly looser than others. I believe this is the real deal and a crazy bargain (so much so I see it is sold out with no restock date)."

It isnt harsh on my hands and I have super dry skin. For the price it was a steal. Only downside is a bottle came busted so I pretty much lost half a bottle and had a mess to clean up thats why i didnt give it a fantastic review. shouldnt have been shipped i think in a box with nothing even stuffing it so it was able to just crash around in the box. Either way the sanitizer is great.

The other purchase was just a week ago but also arrived at the same time. Fortunately, none of my bottles were leaking compared to the other reviews I've read. The bottles that I bought a month ago, came from VA and they had the white cap. The bottles that I bought last week were from IN and they had the other turquoise cap and also came sealed. Also, the background color on the sticker (where it says original hand sanitizer for the turquoise cap is a different shade of blue compared to the white cap (The white cap had a lighter blue sticker). All of these give me an impression that it's not the actual germ-x (not like I would know). I would still buy these as long as it's hand sanitizer and for the great value. Buy at your own risk. I also purchased a different germ-x bottle (aloe with pumps). The box they were in had the germ-x logo on it while these did not."

Hand sanitizers are still kind of difficult to find in my area so when I saw these for under $20 I had to purchase them even it had still had a few at home. The amount I received for the price was excellent. About the product itself; It does exactly what it‚Äôs suppose to do which is sanitize your hands. It doesn‚Äôt leave my hands dry and I do have sensitive skin. I recommend these esp at under $20 for six bottles of 32 ounces.

When I purchased these bottles of sanitizer I was nervous that they would leak in the box during shipment because of what other customers were saying in the reviews but since there were many positive reviews as well I decided to take my chances. I got lucky and my box only had one very tiny leak in one of the bottles which was from a loose cap and only a couple of drops leaked out. I think that this company should put seals on these bottles so that way even if the caps do get loose nothing will leak out during shipment. Overall very good product and one of the best deals on high quality hand sanitizer on Amazon!

2121,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,29-Jun-20,Zak,1,2,Germ-X is really hard to come by and so this seemed like a good deal. The flip top of one of the bottles broke off during shipping. I only lost about 2 inches of product but I did have a slimy mess to clean up. There was a 2-3 inch gap between the top of the bottles and the top of the box - my guess is that the bottles slid repeatedly during shipping due to this poor packaging. More of a problem is that the product smells like feet (my son‚Äôs words). It does not smell like any GermX I have ever used before. I am not sure we will be able to use it due to the stench. Due to the spillage the odor was quite pungent when I opened the box! I would not order again.

It smells extremely strong, like wood alcohol. I do not think this is authentic germ-x. I work in healthcare and this hand sanitizer is very questionable!

Some alcohols can be toxic to your body and I am definitely not risking my family and I getting sick from toxic hand sanitizer."

Other reviews have complained about the formula or texture; apparently the GermX product they received isn't the same as it was prior to the pandemic. I cannot speak to that, but I don't particularly care whether it's true or not. The fact is that the product that I received seems likely to be as effective as any hand sanitizer. It leaves a reasonably nice scent without stickiness or residue. It may be that it has a strong alcohol scent when initially applied (compared to the original formula), but I personally don't care about that one bit. In short: I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The product that I received doesn't have any of the problems that you associate with the cheap hand sanitizer that has apparently flooded the market. It might be slightly inferior to ultra premium hand sanitizers such as Purell, but not enough for it to matter."

It no longer have the pleasant smell and have a very strong rubbing alcohol smell.  Also it's not as thick as the previous formula.  It also isn't fill up all the way either.

The product itself is actually good, and seems to be effective at doing what it's supposed to do, but the people who pack these items need to improve their procedures considerably."

I ordered 3 boxes for the company and one of them came very damaged and one of the bottles had leaked all over part of the box, and the other three were indented in. Because of a tight schedule need and not wanting to waste, we kept them but otherwise would have sent this box back. One of the lids was broken off so we will have to transfer it to another container. The other two were fine, and the larger box they all came in wasn't damaged, so it must have happened at the warehouse, rather than in transit. Some have said it was watered down, but from the gel on the box, I'd say it's pretty normal hand sanitizer. I think it will work well."

Also I understand that durning the pandemic they have to produce the product in such a short amount of time and such big demand, so i wont judge it by the label that not tapped flat and there is no seal under the cap. In general, very good product and there is no leakage in my paper box at all. Thanks a lot."

Each bottle was filled, probably at the 90% mark. Like many comments, this isn‚Äôt the original formula of Germ-X, but it is authentic. If everyone still doesn‚Äôt understand why, you need to know that a massive scarcity has forced hand-sanitizing manufacturers, or those transitioning their manufacturing facility to make sanitizing products, to make their own version. For many, this translates into the use of ethanol for hand-sanitizer production from Isopropyl alcohol, a colorless, flammable chemical compound often used in hand sanitizers."

2219,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,19-Apr-21,Jon,1,,Nope! Scent is NOT original. This stuff literally has a scent that won't go away. Very strong perfume smell that doesn't even wash off with soap and water. Have some original germ-x and it has a pleasant smell. Clearly the formula is different and item is non returnable. Now have 12 10 ounce bottles that won't use. Feel deceived but am thankful out only $10.

All bottles arrived intact, however, the bottles themselves are not sealed & have varying amounts of the sanitizer in them (not all are 32 oz). Therefore, whether or not this is the genuine product is up for debate. It does have a ‚Äútypical‚Äù tolerable smell, unlike some of these newer hand sanitizers. Not being sealed, I guess I can only hope it‚Äôs the actual Germ-X brand and effective as indicated."

The only regret is that we didn't realize that the ethyl alcohol percentage is 62%. We aim to buy hand sanitizers that have an alcohol percentage that is 70% or higher. But I'm sure it still works effectively.

The scent smells more like grain alcohol and it is very watery. I am very familiar with how it feels and smells and this wasn‚Äôt it. The bottles arrived not sealed and one of the caps was just sitting on top. It seems the real product may have been removed and replaced with a homemade variety, and there‚Äôs no telling what the ingredients are or even if it is safe to use. I wish I hadn't tried it, because I have no idea what I just put on my hands. UPDATE: My hands turned very raw and red shortly after using this."

Germ-X doesn't have an offensive smell like some other brands out there. I have tried some hand sanitizers that I put a little squirt on my hands and I can't stomach the smell and can't wash my hands enough to get rid of the smell.  We recommend this hand sanitizer and this seller is offering a great deal.

Because of the brand and the great price, I decided to take a chance. I was very happy when they arrived today and not a single one was damaged or leaking. It is 62% ethyl alcohol, which will do the job per the CDC. Smells like rubbing alcohol to me. Much better than the tequila smell of some others we purchased.  It is more watery than I'm used to, but I think the thickening agents are in short supply. Happy to have a good supply on hand for the upcoming fall and winter season!"

One of the boxes had the lids loose on almost every bottle, and one bottle was about half full from spillage. The other box the lids were loose and the bottles were wet, and one bottle had lost about a quarter or slightly less, but they were all messy with spillage. I'm hoping I will get one bottle to replace what had spilled. Of course its a breeze to clean up, so that part isn't a big deal."

Threw the product out and tried to leave a review advising I thought it was a fraudulent product.  It was moderated and I was advised they would not post my review."

However, now I feel like I got bamboozled. I literally just received these items and let me just say I was deeply disturbed as the bottles look tampered with. Two of the bottles have dish soap lids and don‚Äôt look original. I have no idea what I received in those bottles. As you can see in the picture some bottles have more liquid than others. The bottles were sticky and also the bag they were wrapped in was pretty gross. I had to wash my hands immediately after. I won‚Äôt be buying from this seller again."

The box, on the other hand, was fairly germ free! Also, I wanted to add that I compared the bottle's labeling, ingredients (active, inactive, and order of ingredients), smell, and viscosity to a recent Office Dep. purchase. Everything was exactly same. Seems to be legit."

If I'm being honest, the smell reminds me of some really bottom shelf tequila. I'm sure it works the same, maybe? I don't know, but I do know that it is not the original Germ-X. It has the funny smell, and and it super watery. Think twice before you buy unless you don't mind the differences."

The flip top gets loose easily and there is always some spillage in the box when delivered. There is no seal. Recommend for the manufacturer or amazon to tape the caps to prevent item from spilling. My other complaint as well is that the bottle is never full specifically for these bottle types. Either the products evaporate because the caps are loose, they spill, or the manufacturer does not fill to top. I don‚Äôt seem to have issue with other items from Germ-X."

It seems someone just poured substance in a hurry without really caring if it would spill or not. One of the bottle already is 20% less than other three.

But overall for the price I was satisfied it is not the original germ-x smell or gel consistency since the ingredients are scarce but it still smells way better than many new sanitizers.
2937,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,18-Jun-20,Eleni O,1,,Really runny and not like any other Germ-Ex I bought in the past. Water is the main ingredient in these.

2938,hand_sanitizer,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V653L5,30-Jan-21,Amazon Customer,3,,Overall it came as expected until I opened up the package. One of the bottles had a cap that was not only broken off but completely missing. The other three in the set were fine.
