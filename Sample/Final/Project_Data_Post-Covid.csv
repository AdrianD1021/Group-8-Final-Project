disposable_gloves,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYV178H,1/2/2021,Post_Covid,Discipula Noctis,5,,"COVID purchase. I wanted some inexpensive gloves for shopping trips, and to protect my hands from all the disinfectant wipes and sprays I'm using these days, and for when I'm loading ""contaminated"" laundry into the washer. I also use disposable gloves to clean up after the pets and handle raw meat and fish. They've served well. I also use nitrile gloves for certain tasks, and for work at my retail job. Using the cheaper vinyl gloves for quick jobs that don't require touch sensitivity helps me conserve the more expensive nitrile gloves for jobs that do. For those who haven't used vinyl gloves: They will fit much more loosely than a nitrile glove of the same size. They tend to cling to your fingernails and eventually (depending on use) start tearing where the nails poke through. Any chunky jewelry will tear them. Pulling them on too hard or with wet hands will tear them, as with disposable gloves of other materials."

If you think you're getting these ""inexpensive"" gloves and ""wow look there's so many inside!""  They probably give you so many because they rip so often, usually right around the palm area or right at the wrist.  And yes I bought the right size. 3-  Super duper thin.  Think deli gloves.

But I must say they are way overpriced for a supposedly inexpensive disposable glove. These are the same gloves I used to buy in the 99 cent store for $1.59 before the pandemic. And that was kind of  high price considering the store is named the 99 cent store. That's back when I just used them for cleaning and cooking. Now I used them when I go shopping at the supermarket, pharmacy, etc. in addition to cleaning and cooking. Now they are $9.99 in the 99 cent store which is way too high and $17.99 on Amazon which is way, way too high."

The vinyl gloves tore every time I put one on to use it and it wasn't because of the size.  They just weren't good quality in my opinion. After three torn gloves in a row I decided to exchange them for the ones I was familiar with - MedPrice Nitrile Gloves.  The handling of the return and replacement was fantastic; couldn't be happier with the service and am very pleased with the nitrile gloves.  There is quite a big difference in price from vinyl to nitrile but well worth it for sanitary reasons.

They start with tiny red itchy bumps, and end up with most of the hand/wrist being covered with severe redness/bumps, that often become flaky or crack and sometimes bleed. I’ve worked in a hospital for almost 9 years, so you can imagine the torture my hands went through, even more so with COVID. From my NP to a dermatologist, both thought my condition was either fungal infection or severe heat rash. I tried fungal, anti-itch, and steroid creams, along with specific creams for eczema and psoriasis- none of which which truly helped. Many months later (and a butt ton of money), I’ve discovered that I’m allergic to Nitrile gloves, which happens to be the only gloves my hospital uses because they’re generally powder and latex free. Since early this year, I’ve been using these gloves at work instead of the Nitrile gloves, and my hands have healed up tremendously! I’ve gone from looking like I’d dipped my hands in acid, to practically normal looking hands again. These gloves aren’t quite as durable as others and can easily rip if applying too much pressure with putting them on, so I went up to a size medium to avoid struggling with putting them on- easy fix! I don’t have a before and after photo of my hands, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. I’ll continue to repurchase these as they alone have saved my hands!!"

Regular “one size fits all” gloves are always way too big on me, I have small hands. So I figured I would size up to a medium (normally I’d think to order small) and these medium are the sizes of one size fits all, they are too loose on me. I like to use these while cooking and these started sliding off, I need to order another set in small or I’ll have to use rubber bands at the wrists everytime to make sure they don’t move around. So just size normal, don’t size up."

However, as long as your hands are totally dry and you slip them on slowly, carefully over the fingers first, then down your hand, they go on well.

Yes, I have had a few break on that last pull over my palm but I usually take the time to do it carefully. I ordered more because they are more readily available and a few dollars less than nitrile. I am glad I ordered the medium size though; I have nitrile gloves in small that fit my hand nicely, but these in a small would not have worked at all. So, think about the sizing, one size up, because had I known this before and ordered the XL for my husband and adult son, they might work better for them.

Cons: Sizing inaccurate -- please see below. Comments: 1. First box was large & fit a male with medium-large size hands, but difficulty getting on & off.  This was likely attributable to the fact that they're vinyl (with inherently little stretch) and powder-less, all as expected.  One shouldn't expect anything different than what one ordered. 2. Second box was for female with TINY hands , conventionally wearing size XS (or small if gloves run tight).  Based on reader reviews, ordered medium and sure glad we did!  While there's room to spare at fingertips & a bit elsewhere, clearly the small would either not fit or be challenging (and therefore tear) if we selected small. 3. Because one must oversize and have room to spare, due to the nature of vinyl, we do NOT recommend vinyl for tasks that require fine detail or good touch sensation.  But this is the nature of the beast, NOT a problem for this glove. Thanks to prior reviewers, and hope this info helps someone else!"

I use gloves a lot when I do different paint-resin-wood crafts/projects, so when I had to purchase another box, I liked these because of the price.  I got Medium and they run a little small and start to tear when trying to pull them on.  Once you've got them on, they serve their purpose with small projects, but if you have to wash your paintbrushes, you'll find yourself with a torn fingertip or two. They also leave a sour ""after-smell"" on your hands like mildew."

I’ve ordered several from different vendors and these have been the worst yet. I would Like to return them but I just don’t feel like going through the  trouble for a little money. I’m not sure if it’s because they run small that they rip at the top when you’re trying to pull them up or they’re just not thick enough. I ordered medium I wish I would’ve ordered possibly a large but as I said too much trouble to return. I would not order these again. Maybe my review would’ve been different if I would’ve ordered a different size.
