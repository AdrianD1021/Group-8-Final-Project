3000,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,19-Aug-17,Hillary,1,379,"I was excited to order these as they had good reviews... plus there was a coupon available.  I was rather disappointed when I received the containers in horrible condition. The wipes had leaked, the labels were saturated and were shredded. The ink on the plastic container had transferred to the containers and I actually had to use the wipes to clean up the mess. I was excited to find an item that I regularly purchase online for a good deal, but after my experience, I think I'll continue to purchase my wipes in store."
3001,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,17-Jan-18,Amazon Customer,1,240,"These have gone down in quality, now each individual container is not sealed, and the wipes themselves, are very different.  Might as well get the off-brand wipes since Lysol reduced what was the king of disposable wipes to nothing more than another common wipe.  I don't understand, lysol usually has good quality stuff, these aren't quality."
3002,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,11-May-20,Ana Alberto,1,63,"It’s very disappointing to receive My order in these conditions! I understand that the need to fulfill orders is overwhelming but it’s no excuse to not properly prepare and ship the orders. These containers were in a box more then twice it’s size without any filling to support them and avoid the container to tilt and disinfecting liquid spilling out. As result, I’m going to have dried out wipes! With the horrible pandemic and how we are all trying to fight against and stay healthy, this is very upsetting & stressing to say the least."
3003,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,20-Apr-18,Kimberly,3,81,"I did receive this and it felt like they may have been a very hot place, or humid place.  That would make sense if they were in a warehouse that is hot.  I just hope that the wipes will be wet enough to actually clean with these.  I also hope that they are not ready to be expired.  I mean these things don’t last for ever.  I wish they would.  These are so easy to clean with and, safe to use on practically anything. Ok I just cleaned with these.  Yes it took more wipes then normal.  I usually only use these in the bathroom.  I normall uae vinegar and water to clean the house but, saw a lot of bad reviews on here.  So yes I have to agree with others they I will not buying these again.  I bought the Clorox ones on here and, they were awesome.  I think Lysol was not as good anymore or maybe just from Amazon."
3004,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,15-May-17,Daniela,5,92,"Let's face it, cleaning is already a task most of us do not look forward to so why not make it easier? For me, wipes are the answer. Before these I was spraying with a cleaner that was probably spraying in places I didn't want it to, waiting for the cleaner to soak in before using paper towels to finally wipe off the food particles and spills. Now I simply grab a wipe out of the container and everything comes off in one step and I can clean with the wipe exactly where I want to, unlike a spray. The packaging makes it easy to tear off one or as many as you need and closes tightly. These work better to really help loosen and remove any stuck on food that I would usually have to scrub off with other cleaning products. I should also mention I used to buy Clorox wipes but these leave less lint than the Clorox did. I would have to wipe the lint away with a rag after cleaning with those, not saving me any time. These Lysol wipes work great, one goes a long way and they arrived in perfect condition. I'll be buying for life (until one day when I hopefully become rich and can afford a great housekeeper, that is.)"
3005,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,18-Jan-18,The eBook Investigator,1,81,I've always been a fan of Lysol but certainly not these. Every time I try to clean with them I end up with an awful headache. I must add that I'm sensitive to fragrances and ones that bother me tend to lead to migraines like these do. Not worth it for me to go through the misery. If you don't have those types of sensitivities they may work out well.
3006,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,6-Apr-18,KJ,1,73,I received these yesterday and they were a soggy mess.  When I removed the outer wrapping all of the canister labels came with it because they were soaking wet.  It's impossible to tell how many of the canisters leaked but there was a whole lot of product lost to leakage.
3007,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,21-Jun-20,Jerry,2,29,"I compared Lysol vs Clorox wipes.  I have to said Clorox is the winner!  Why? Because Lysol wipe drys up fast. Not enough liquid solution. It’s hard to disinfect a surface when the wipe is dry.  I noticed Clorox weights 581g(78 wipes) vs Lysol only 473g(80 wipes).  Lysol is lighter, definitely dryer."
3008,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,10-Apr-18,Michael M.,5,21,"These are great for little messes that might require a bit of anti-bacterial action.  We keep them in the kitchen for things like wiping down countertops after preparing chicken or other foods that might carry bacteria.  A  quick wipe down with them on the counters, stovetop, etc. makes us all feel a little safer about what we eat and where we prepare our food.  They clean, plus give you the satisfaction of knowing that you are not only cleaning, but you are disinfecting at the same time.  A must-have for the whole house."
3009,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,28-May-20,Virginia G McCarey,2,9,"Just had my order arrive. It came in a plastic bag, rather than a box. Right off the bat I could smell the lemon scent before I had even removed the wipes from the bag. Then I reached in the bag and felt the moisture. It was my original intention to give these wipes to my son and his wife. After opening the plastic wrap around the containers I came across loose, torn and wet labels. There is no way I can give these to anyone. Due to the loss of liquid there is no telling how effective they will be. I do have a 2nd order going direct to my daughter in NY. I hope her shipment has better luck. Update; 5/30/20 The 2nd order arrived at my daughter's house in perfect condition. This time it was in a box and shipped out of Texas. Mine as mentioned above was in a plastic bag and shipped out of Michigan. The system will not allow me to write a different review for the new shipment. I thought it only fair to report to good results as well as the bad."
3010,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,10-Sep-20,Eva,1,9,"I received my package back in July and just opened them tonight...to my surprise, two of the four canisters had NO LIDS!?  Not sure if these are safe to use now!?  And I am too late to ask for a refund because I waited too long to open up the package.  Buyer beware!"
3011,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,10-Jun-20,R. Arless,1,8,"I can live with the slightly cheaper container which it truly is, can't see this as real problem.as long as the product is still good, Problem is, the product has been cheapened too I actually like the new style of the wipe, in theory it seems like it would last longer BUT THE WIPES HARDLY HAVE A ENOUGH CLEANING LIQUID TO BE USEFUL. The old old one came wet, there was excess liquid in every container. This is ridiculous, this cleaning liquid costs practically nothing to make. The price is now over 25 percent higher than before. Not going to be repurchasing an overpriced roll of tiny paper towels which are barely moist."
3012,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,2-May-20,E. Kenyon,5,7,"So happy to find these and I love this product. I will be dropping most of mine of at a nurse's home who works directly with COVID patients. Please do not hoard these in these times and check in with your essential worker friends/family to see if they need any. Message from a nurse: As some of you know for 5 and a half weeks now I’ve been caring for Covid 19 patients in the ICU/Emergency Room and Step down units. In the very beginning we used a new face shield, mask and gown every time we entered a room. We are now allowed one mask every 3 shifts and one face shield forever. We depend on wipes to clean our face shields every time we exit a room. Without being able to clean these we would be passing the virus from room to room and literally be bringing it home in our cars/on our shoes to our families. We also use these wipes for shared equipment (X-ray machines, dialysis machines etc) I know these have been really hard to find, but if anyone scored some, my colleagues, patients and I would love any wipes you’d be able to share"
3013,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,6-Mar-20,Amazon Customer,5,9,Love these wipes for convenience! I bought a multipack for a great price back in the summer. So disappointed that the same multipack was jacked up to over $40 now with all the health concerns. Shame on Amazon for taking advantage of people!!!
3014,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,7-Jan-20,ArgoFX,1,9,The picture for this product is deceptive. It shows that it will be in a plastic can but what I received definitely wasn’t in a plastic can. It’s in a bag form instead where you open the plastic lid attached to the bag and pull out a wipe. Similar to like baby wipe packaging and one can easily get them mixed up which is why I liked the cans better. It’s not worth the trouble for me to go and return them though. They should update the image to this product so that they’re not tricking customers regarding what they will receive.
3015,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,26-Feb-20,Bookworm42,5,4,"I use these everywhere at home, work, and on the go. We keep these everywhere at work when someone is sick we go on a massive cleaning spree. Wipes are in every room and we stay healthy! A tip for those that travel: put a few of these in a sandwich bag and they’ll stay good when you travel. Better, cheaper way to wipe down tray tables and arm rests. At the hotel wipe down doorknobs, light switches and the tv controller. Carry the same in car or purse and save vs buying the travel packs with their massive convenience markup. Happy travels!"
3016,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,6-Mar-20,Goodrollmodel,5,7,Bought these before the big Corona scare. They have gone up significantly in price since my purchase.
3017,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,26-Oct-20,Huyph4m,5,3,I really miss the days when I can actually get a real deal on these but nowadays just finding these for MSRP and having availability is a blessing. I've always loved Lysol products and this is no different. The wipes have a good thickness to them and won't disintegrate or get destroyed when you're using them to sanitize your surroundings or objects. The scent is nice as well and it's really nice just having a couple delivered to your door. Would definitely buy again as they have been my go-to wise for years but as you know they can be very hard to find right now.
3018,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,25-Feb-21,Wahab Alansari,3,5,"The post covid wipes are not as strong as the old ones (see pic for weight difference: 513g old vs. 473g for the new ones). Also, the old wipes had dimples. The new ones are flat and are thinner, less liquid (see second pic).. After all the wait i am disappointed!"
3019,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,30-Oct-17,Carla H,4,10,"Sometimes I wish the wipes were a little bigger so I could fold them over sometimes. I end up using a few for some purposes that I thought were going to be a one and done deal. I like the scent and it takes off the gross brown stuff that's under the rim of the stove burners. It won't take off a wine stain on the cheap counters at my apartment, I still have to break out spot cleaner for that. I switch out between these, Clorox and Wegmans brands and they are all pretty comparable."
3020,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,7-Jul-20,Amanda Claunch,1,5,I didnt open mine right after i got them. I just now did and went to look at the reviews and sure enough the same crap..every single one of mine leaked out everywhere and the labels are all torn up and everythings a huge mess. Will NOT be buying from this seller again
3021,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,4-Sep-20,Cowboy,5,5,"Four containers of glorious disinfecting wipes at a great price!  80 wipes per container and 320 wipes total in the package.  These wipes clean well and smell great.  These used to be so easy to find, now it takes a miracle to find them in the stores or on Amazon.  I have been blessed."
3022,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,12-Jan-21,Marcia in Modesto,5,One,"These are great to have around and to keep on order in case stores run out during this pandemic. We've been using them for many years though for cleaning and sanitizing inside and outdoors by The animals food area. The packaging is leak proof from our experience, and the scent is clean without being overpowering. Each towelette is a good size ..not tiny, and there are plenty wet. When we have finished using them there is still some of the liquid in the bottom of the plastic container. They're easy to open easy to dispense we've been using them for years and will continue to get these exact ones. I hope this helps you decide what to get.stay safe!"
3023,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,31-May-20,Amazon Customer,5,2,"Lysol is the best brand for disinfecting stuff. My one minor complain is its packaging. Clorox has an air tight film cover on every new canister, which is helpful to prevent leak in delivery transportation. I wish Lysol does the same thing. Lysol offers a better price instead so cannot be compared with any absolute standard. Anyway, I cannot choose one from the other during this pandemic. I should snap whatever is available for sale without looking at its brand. By the way, when can I buy Solimo wipes again ?"
3024,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,29-Jul-20,Tiffany,5,One,"Product is great. I keep 1 in each car, 1 under each sink, and 1 in the laundry room. I have the 4 pack set up on auto-delivery. It's like an easy button, and a safety button in one. Provides peace of mind when traveling, grocery shopping, pumping gas, and between deep cleanings and hand washings. Note: if used to wipe hands, in the car, dryness will occur. Don't use this as a substitute for hand washing or deep cleaning, but it does the trick between jobs and traveling. Very convenient. I hate the use of too much plastic, but weighing out risk/benefits, this one is a necessity.  I don't have kids in school, but if I did, there would be one in every backpack and locker. :)"
3025,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,18-Sep-20,Amazon Customer,1,5,Receive package today.. all 4 canisters are dented and warped. 1 had no liquid inside the canister and wipes were not moist. 2 have cracked and broken lids that have the contents exposed for drying out.  Very disappointed 😞
3026,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,24-Aug-20,Kat,5,3,"You HAVE to do the wipe dance if you're able to score disinfecting wipes during this pandemic! The Disinfecting Gods must know that you appreciate them! But on the real, I've used Lysol wipes even before Covid 19, and they are trustworthy and durable. They last a long time in the canisters. Just beware, when you get to the last couple pieces, that your hand might get stuck!"
3027,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,7-Apr-21,SN,5,,"After a whole year I’ve finally snagged some Lysol wipes! This is the Bentley of disinfectant wipes! The design of the container is unique you can easily put your fingers in the big opening and take out a wipe or more without unscrewing the top and place the unused end into the notch and start feeding the roll. It pulls out and then rips cleanly since there are perforations. Other brands require you to constantly unscrew the top to feed the wipes that keep slipping back in or rip halfway. The scent on this is STRONG. That way my clients will know that I wiped down the treatment table and stuff. If you use it too much it may cause nasal discomfort, which is why I swap other lesser scented brands like Amazons Solimo, heh heh. Get this today before it’s gone! note as of 4/7/21 - they’re sold out :("
3028,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,6-Nov-17,ClaireElaine,3,6,"Arrived in a very large box with many other items. Something smushed the containers and several of them leaked cleaning fluid all over everything in the box. By the time we got the box, mildew had started to form in the cardboard under one of the Lysol containers. Everything else in the box was small: various makeups which were sealed and fine but slimy, small fidget toys which were not harmed by cleaning fluid, but also a pack of toothbrushes which had the cardboard backing all soaked, so they will need to go through the dishwasher before we put them in our mouths. Lysol is not toothpaste. Lol"
3029,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,28-May-20,MCLP,5,One,"I read previous reviews to know the package may come leaking or damaged, and was willing to take the risk. There was a minor amount of leaking in my box, but nothing huge. The wipes are all still wet and the labels on each canister mostly survived. I believe the canisters look different than in the photo (ie, with the clear tops instead of the yellow) because Lysol and Clorox are producing as much as they can as quickly as they can, which probably means obtaining different containers. Fine by me! Also, if you have a container running out, you can use the leftover liquid from that one and pour it into one of these if yours is too dry. Also, when I first ordered mine the delivery estimate was July 13, but it changed and they came today! I ordered these five days ago, May 23."
3030,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,7-Jan-21,Shelby,5,,"I bought these because I'm having such a hard time finding them in the stores. Thankfully amazon came through for me. I use these bad boys to clean pretty much everything in my house right now, as we have people who go out into the world to work and such. I know, I'm probably being crazy, but I don't really care. I used to use these to wipe my counters down in the kitchen and clean the bathrooms and all. I don't really think you can go too wrong with having a kitchen that's too clean or a bathroom that's too clean. As a side note, does anyone else really just like the scent of lemon in their kitchen? I usually prefer the fresh (blue/green) scent for the bathroom and this lemon (yellow) scent for my kitchen. Maybe that's weird, idk."
3031,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,19-Apr-20,Emily,5,3,"Two of the containers (the ones on the ends)  were dented and a little damaged upon arrival, but honestly I feel lucky to even have been able to get a 4 pack of these during these times, and at a good price. I hope these become more widely available for everyone soon.  Thank you!"
3032,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,20-Mar-20,Love My Cat!,5,One,"My Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (4 containers, 80 wipes each=320 wipes with lemon-lime scent arrived today in perfect condition--no leaks, all lid openings closed, all wipes appropriately ”wet” with cleaning solution. The scent is noticeable but I imagine it will dissipate quickly. I was very worried after all the negative reviews I saw about the condition of the containers upon delivery, so I was almost afraid to open them!  I am pleased that in the midst of these difficult times with the COVID-19 virus attacking the USA and everyone ordering disinfecting products that these wipes arrived in a timely manner in perfect condition. I look forward to cleaning my countertops and doorknobs with this product. That should help keep the COVID-19 virus at bay. Stay healthy everyone:  wash your hands and stay home!"
3033,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,30-May-20,Dynamo713,5,2,"One of the best products for disinfecting and doesn’t disappoint. The package comes with 4 bottles with 80 wipes each. The scent is not too strong so that’s a plus. As long as you keep the lid closed every time you use a wipe, these could last a long time. I rather go with a well known brand than those generic alcohol wipes"
3034,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,4-Dec-20,erika a.,1,One,"Any time I have purchased any type of cleaning or sanitizing wipe they have always had a seal on the container. Upon opening these I discovered none of them were sealed, there was no fluid inside and they were barely moist enough to use, and two of the containers had this reddish brownish tint inside of the wipes. These hardly seem sanitary or something I would want to wipe high use items down with."
3035,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,17-Jan-18,Bucky55,1,9,"The liquid leaked out of the canisters.  3 canisters all the wipers were bone dry and the fourth was almost bone dry.  Leakage caused the labels to become wet and they came off the canisters.  I will get Clorox the nest time, they put an air tight seal then the lid."
3036,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,29-Sep-20,Lilly White,2,,"The tops of these wipes' containers easily open.  Put them sideways in the box and it makes it even worse!  That's the way I received them, wet on the outside.  Hopefully, they retained enough liquid to be useful.  They smell horrible!!!  I had put something atop them and the stench (don't smell anything like lemon or lime!) leached onto it almost immediately.  I'm guessing because the tops aren't a tight seal.  I put tape around the tops of the ones I'm not yet using because I want to keep the smelly liquid in and the stench out!  Next time I'm (hopefully) buying the ones from the local store which closed perfectly and had a nice smell."
3037,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,14-Oct-20,LoyalAmazonCustomer,4,One,Love this product. Definitely prefer to Clorox wipes. Haven’t been able to find since the pandemic. Was lucky to get the 4 pack for 12.99. And came about 2 weeks earlier than expected date. Only thing I don’t like is the snap lid doesn't snap as easily as the ones I used to get in the stores when I could a actually find them. So make sure you press down so it’s fully snapped or they’ll run dry.
3038,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,24-Jun-18,Chintana Owens,2,3,This had leaked all over the box making everything smell (& taste) like it that came with this. I threw over $90 worth of items away because of the leak. PROS: Not exp. All wipes seem to hold its moisture & tops close fine for a tight seal. CONS: POORLY PACKAGED. Liquid from ALL containers leaked all over my other items in the box. The box was so saturated in the liquid that the bottom was tearing open & this was a big box. I will be removing this from my sub & save.
3039,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,24-Mar-21,D S,5,,"Lysol Disinfecting Wipes washes off pesky scum or stains with a few wipes, and the lemon & lime scent is pleasant and maintains its aroma for a whole hour. The smell is slightly strong, so if you have a sensitive nose, I would suggest wearing a mask. Discovering that its use can also work on electronics was surprising, and after testing the wipes on my laptop, phone, electronic accessories, and game consoles, I have considered purchasing more in bulk very soon. The wipes kill bacteria on their surfaces, which is especially acknowledgeable during the current COVID-19 pandemic. For those who eat-and-game with messy hands, these wipes do their job at leaving controllers and screens with a smooth, shiny, and dry finish with just one wipe alone. In fact, a single wipe can stay moist for an extended period of time, so do not be concerned if a wipe will not be enough to clean a single area or device."
3040,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,1-Sep-20,Madison T. Edwards,5,One,"Great wipes! I use these disinfecting wipes for just about everything. I keep a cannister in the kitchen and each bathroom.  I use these for wiping down countertops, appliances, toilets and tubs.  I also use these for wiping down doors and door knobs and our electronics. These came well packaged and I was very happy to receive them since they are so hard to find lately."
3041,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,28-May-20,Desiree,3,2,"When I was able to order these sanitizing wipes online I felt like I won the lottery during this pandemic (Covid-19).  They arrived in their usual sealed packaging (it’s a 4-pack) in a typical shipping box.  For whatever reason, the Lysol company no longer had a seal on the tops of the individual containers of wipes and once I opened the sealed packaging there was liquid all throughout.  As I am in desperate need of wipes, I found 3 of the containers leaked only a little bit, while the 4th is quite dry.  I am keeping them but will continue to search for them in a store rather than ship them."
3042,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,21-Sep-20,🌟Angie🌙☀️,5,,"So glad that Amazon have it, and lucky me that I was able to bought 3 sets of them. Price is so good and it arrived as soon as it was back in stock, which was about 3 days. I shared them with my friends and  neighbors since all of us can’t buy it from anywhere. Nowadays, sanitizers, masks and back in stock everywhere but Disinfectant wipes are still soooo hard to get! Can’t find it anywhere, Target walmart and local convenience stores. I only have 2 bottles left, and my family and I use many of it everyday. We have to keep things disinfectant for our 3months old baby and a 6yrs old boy."
3043,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,26-Oct-20,Gavins Mom,5,2,Yes!!!! It’s Lysol! Exactly how I remembered!  I was surprised when my order went through and even more surprised when it arrived! Smells amazing and works great!
3044,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,2-Mar-21,Tom,1,2,Are these legitimate Lysol wipes? Labels falling off.. Packages all leaking. Not the usual container they are in. Would not buy these from Amazon again
3045,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,9-Jul-20,Jennifer,2,,"Ok, I really like these wipes. They hold on together well and are an easy way to wipe down countertops, light switches, packages and more. BUT the new 'stronger' redesign they just did means it's impossible to separate them. Now instead of easily tearing off a wipe I have to painstakingly fan out about two wipes, search for the division, and attempt to pull apart starting right from the edge. Even then it still ends up ripping the wipes down the edge half the time:( Can you please go back to the old version?"
3046,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,19-Apr-20,Sarah,5,One,"There are Lysol wipes under all of our sinks because they are that handle (heck I we even have them in the trucks and boat).  They are easy to operator with one hand, pop the top and pull one out, clean up the mess and move on with your day.  It is just that simple.  They are gentle enough to use on just about all surfaces and they are durable enough to use for light scrubbing."
3047,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,21-Feb-21,Samantha L,2,One,"I bought a lot of hoarded, afraid of them are out of stock. Now every time i go to the supermarket to buy things, I always wipe them with disinfectant wipes before I move them to the house. I feel the quality of this purchase is not as good as before, easy to get dry, not much soap in the container anymore. Disappointed!"

3049,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,8-May-20,Chris Garcia,5,2,Just what I was expecting. Lysol wipes. They do the job. Not a fan of the chemical smell because I am used to more earthy cleaning products. They were packages well and arrived without damage.
3050,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,29-Jul-20,Kristen,3,,Normally the wipes are good but whoever packaged them did a poor job. They put them in a bag vs a box and the bag must've been handled hard and the pack was ripped leading to 2 of the containers having the tops opened &wipes were mostly dried out. Given it's so hard to find wipes I did keep the rest. The undamaged containers worked as expected & cleaned well. Scent is ok...a little strong.  Not sure if this is how the wipes are always shipped (in a bag vs a box) or if mine were a fluke.
3051,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,15-Sep-20,Jayce,5,,"I was so excited to finally catch these available that I blindly ordered. After I read the reviews I almost cancelled but decided to just go with it. I mean, I've not been able to find any since March anyways. They just came in. ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES! They were packaged properly, no leaks, no dents, just perfect. I cannot believe how much I missed the smell of these wipes too! Maybe they're just a hit or miss when ordering, but I definitely received a hit!!!"
3052,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,17-Jan-21,Jeepers,5,,Lysol wipes are the only wipes my sensitive smell senses can handle. I used to buy these religiously every other month pre-pandemic. This is the first package I have finally been able to get since  feb 2020 which was the last time I was ever able to find some. I was so worried I’d get a box of old or imitation wipes based on sites and reviews I’d seen. But these were just like the ones I used to buy from the stores. Very relieved and happy! My only disapproval was the delivery person left my box randomly nearby my apartment rather than right in front of my door. They could have made 7 steps and put it right in front of my door and avoid possible confusion and possible theft as it was left at the staircase.
3053,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,8-Sep-20,G. L. Jones,5,,"Cleans well and disinfects as lysol always has.  Packaging is difficult to keep wipes in the ""tear"" area and wipes do not tear every time, so pull carefully.  Other than that they are great.  If the wipes fall on their side, the liquid does not all drain out, which is a vast improvement over past designs.  I carry a pack in my car so I can sanitize when I go into the store if they do not have wipes available for shoppers.  I did this before covid but now it is even more important.  I just wish they were in stock more often, but can't blame that on the sellers, just covid and hoarders.  Great product, as always."

I keep a container of these in my laundry room, kitchen, both bathrooms, family room and living room. It’s great to have them handy for a quick wipe down of different items. I have  Multiple Sclerosis and it’s crucial that I stay as healthy as possible. These wipes are a huge help to me. The scent is clean and fresh without being overwhelming. I will definitely keep buying them."

I'm not sure how long it has been around, but I remember my school used to use it and my parents used it.  Now we are using it.  The wipes are good at cleaning down counters, doors, etc. The scent smells refreshing and clean.  The containers do not leak - I found one that had been knocked on its side.  I thought it was be dried out.  Nope.  Still had the cleaner inside."
3056,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,10-May-20,Lisa Katch,3,2,all 4 tubes i received didn't have any sort of sealed protective film under the lid to prevent liquid from leaking out like my clorox wipes had.  It got everywhere.  I almost feel like the company cut corners in a hurry to make product available to the masses given the current health crisis.  I am also afraid that these are going to dry out much faster without being completely sealed.
3057,disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,4-Feb-21,Another avid reader,4,,"These wipes are great!  The packages contain more liquid disinfectant than some other brands, so you can clean off a larger surface with just one wipe. This also means that all wipes are wet, and you shouldn’t have to discard the last ones in the container.  (Some other brands’ wipes tend to dry up before you use the entire container.) I’ve deducted one star because of the scent.  Although it’s not a bad smell, it’s a bit strong and could be too much for those who are sensitive to scented products."

The wipes smell great and work well. They are well saturated. For anyone who has concerns for them not being individually sealed. I checked the one I purchased from the store and it was not individually sealed either. The store brand or Clorox brand wasn’t sealed either. I’ve always stocked up on these because I have a cat that likes to jump on the counters. Thank you for having these available!

Not surprisingly, it leaked all over.  This will greatly reduce the shelf life for the wipes, as they will now dry out before I can possibly use them all.  This is a shame, since I’ve ordered these wipes in the past with no problems.  If you must order these, I would highly recommend that you don’t order anything else that could be damaged due to leaking."

Good, strong sheets won’t break when you wipe down things and I like the lemon scent.

I opened the box and the lids had popped off a few of the containers and the ones with the tops off had wipes that were already yellowing.  None of the containers a factory seal (inside plastic liner).  So, I'm curious if anyone knows if this is an imitation product or if Lysol brand doesn't come with inner seal.  Little scared to use if not really a Lysol product."

Your masks, microwave, countertops, stove.  You name it can it gives a good clean. I like the multipack because it comes out with a better valve vs a single container.  The scent is nice too. It's a nice citrus smell. Not too strong, but noticeable. I definitely recommend it."

As many others here have caught on, there was a change in the quality of the wipes in the past year or two. Previously, they were strong and lint free, which is why I preferred these over those nasty Chlorox wipes that would leave fibers all over the place. Now that each sheet is thinner and smaller, there's not a clear winner anymore."

The other bottles I purchased individually came with the plastic seal when you open up the lid. This product, all of the 4 bottles, does not have sealant. This will dry the sheets before I use them.

Never dried out. Far better than seventh generation in terms of strength and efficacy though of course it’s not a natural product.

Something had to have busted or leaked at some point during the shipping process because when I opened the shrink wrap that was over all 4 containers, it ripped off all the slightly damp labels. Not a terribly big deal since having a container sans label makes no difference to the product itself, but it did have me a little perplexed and concerned as to why each bottle's label was already damp in the first place.

I keep a cannister in the kitchen and the bathroom at all times."

The smell is wonderful and it definitely leaves a clean feeling. I do agree with the packaging though. It was delivered in a way that you are not sure which way is bottom or top so when you do open them and it was packaged the wrong way the package leaks solution and the wipes dry out quicker.

The pack was deliverd upside down.  When I opened the bag and took off the shrink wrap, I found two of the canisters wet, and the damp labels fell off of the canisters.  The canisters are not sealed at the mouth so liquid must have come out.  Also, one of the canistesr was dented.  We hope the wipes will still be effective at sanitizing, but we will not be buying this again."

However, it seems like the wipe quality has decreased. They still get things clean, but leave lint everywhere they are used so I have to wipe up after them. The wipes also seem to be thinner and wear out quickly while I'm using them. Also, upon delivery the containers were in rough condition. The containers had leaked cleaning solution. I wasn't worried about the labels being damaged so much as I was that there wouldn't be enough liquid remaining to keep the wipes from drying out."
