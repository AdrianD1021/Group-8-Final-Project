disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,4/7/2021,Post_Covid,SN,5,,"After a whole year I‚Äôve finally snagged some Lysol wipes! This is the Bentley of disinfectant wipes! The design of the container is unique you can easily put your fingers in the big opening and take out a wipe or more without unscrewing the top and place the unused end into the notch and start feeding the roll. It pulls out and then rips cleanly since there are perforations. Other brands require you to constantly unscrew the top to feed the wipes that keep slipping back in or rip halfway. The scent on this is STRONG. That way my clients will know that I wiped down the treatment table and stuff. If you use it too much it may cause nasal discomfort, which is why I swap other lesser scented brands like Amazons Solimo, heh heh. Get this today before it‚Äôs gone! note as of 4/7/21 - they‚Äôre sold out :("

No liquid in any of the containers. The wipes were just damp. The only reason that I‚Äôm using them is because these were very hard to get because of the Coronavirus problem and I don‚Äôt want to throw them out. I would have returned them and reordered them but they are sold out.
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,5/10/2020,Post_Covid,Lisa Katch,3,2,all 4 tubes i received didn't have any sort of sealed protective film under the lid to prevent liquid from leaking out like my clorox wipes had.  It got everywhere.  I almost feel like the company cut corners in a hurry to make product available to the masses given the current health crisis.  I am also afraid that these are going to dry out much faster without being completely sealed.

Packaging is difficult to keep wipes in the ""tear"" area and wipes do not tear every time, so pull carefully.  Other than that they are great.  If the wipes fall on their side, the liquid does not all drain out, which is a vast improvement over past designs.  I carry a pack in my car so I can sanitize when I go into the store if they do not have wipes available for shoppers.  I did this before covid but now it is even more important.  I just wish they were in stock more often, but can't blame that on the sellers, just covid and hoarders.  Great product, as always."

I don't really think you can go too wrong with having a kitchen that's too clean or a bathroom that's too clean. As a side note, does anyone else really just like the scent of lemon in their kitchen?

The old old one came wet, there was excess liquid in every container. This is ridiculous, this cleaning liquid costs practically nothing to make. The price is now over 25 percent higher than before. Not going to be repurchasing an overpriced roll of tiny paper towels which are barely moist."

Not enough liquid solution. It‚Äôs hard to disinfect a surface when the wipe is dry.  I noticed Clorox weights 581g(78 wipes) vs Lysol only 473g(80 wipes).  Lysol is lighter, definitely dryer."

The smell is wonderful and it definitely leaves a clean feeling. I do agree with the packaging though. It was delivered in a way that you are not sure which way is bottom or top so when you do open them and it was packaged the wrong way the package leaks solution and the wipes dry out quicker. If they can fix this problem by putting a seal or a tighter fitting cap they will have a customer for life. Thanks LYSOL!!

There was a minor amount of leaking in my box, but nothing huge. The wipes are all still wet and the labels on each canister mostly survived. I believe the canisters look different than in the photo (ie, with the clear tops instead of the yellow) because Lysol and Clorox are producing as much as they can as quickly as they can, which probably means obtaining different containers. Fine by me! Also, if you have a container running out, you can use the leftover liquid from that one and pour it into one of these if yours is too dry. Also, when I first ordered mine the delivery estimate was July 13, but it changed and they came today! I ordered these five days ago, May 23."

I've always loved Lysol products and this is no different. The wipes have a good thickness to them and won't disintegrate or get destroyed when you're using them to sanitize your surroundings or objects. The scent is nice as well and it's really nice just having a couple delivered to your door. Would definitely buy again as they have been my go-to wise for years but as you know they can be very hard to find right now.

The smell is slightly strong, so if you have a sensitive nose, I would suggest wearing a mask. Discovering that its use can also work on electronics was surprising, and after testing the wipes on my laptop, phone, electronic accessories, and game consoles, I have considered purchasing more in bulk very soon. The wipes kill bacteria on their surfaces, which is especially acknowledgeable during the current COVID-19 pandemic. For those who eat-and-game with messy hands, these wipes do their job at leaving controllers and screens with a smooth, shiny, and dry finish with just one wipe alone. In fact, a single wipe can stay moist for an extended period of time, so do not be concerned if a wipe will not be enough to clean a single area or device."

They hold on together well and are an easy way to wipe down countertops, light switches, packages and more. BUT the new 'stronger' redesign they just did means it's impossible to separate them. Now instead of easily tearing off a wipe I have to painstakingly fan out about two wipes, search for the division, and attempt to pull apart starting right from the edge. Even then it still ends up ripping the wipes down the edge half the time:( Can you please go back to the old version?"

Provides peace of mind when traveling, grocery shopping, pumping gas, and between deep cleanings and hand washings. Note: if used to wipe hands, in the car, dryness will occur. Don't use this as a substitute for hand washing or deep cleaning, but it does the trick between jobs and traveling. Very convenient. I hate the use of too much plastic, but weighing out risk/benefits, this one is a necessity.  I don't have kids in school, but if I did, there would be one in every backpack and locker. :)"

Message from a nurse: As some of you know for 5 and a half weeks now I‚Äôve been caring for Covid 19 patients in the ICU/Emergency Room and Step down units. In the very beginning we used a new face shield, mask and gown every time we entered a room. We are now allowed one mask every 3 shifts and one face shield forever. We depend on wipes to clean our face shields every time we exit a room. Without being able to clean these we would be passing the virus from room to room and literally be bringing it home in our cars/on our shoes to our families. We also use these wipes for shared equipment (X-ray machines, dialysis machines etc) I know these have been really hard to find, but if anyone scored some, my colleagues, patients and I would love any wipes you‚Äôd be able to share"

I had put something atop them and the stench (don't smell anything like lemon or lime!) leached onto it almost immediately.  I'm guessing because the tops aren't a tight seal.  I put tape around the tops of the ones I'm not yet using because I want to keep the smelly liquid in and the stench out!

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,9/24/2020,Post_Covid,Kelly,5,,"We have been using a lot of wipes lately, so I'm always happy when Amazon has them back in stock. They arrived in perfect condition - no leaks.  I personally prefer the smell of these to the Clorox ones, but your opinion may differ.  We pour any left over liquid from the empty container into the new container to make sure the wipes stay really wet."
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,5/16/2020,Post_Covid,zandora,5,One,"We keep a tub of this in the car to wipe off drive through cups of soda and even the straw wrappers. Car handles, steering wheel, actually all car surfaces. It removed grime on the glove box that the car detailer wasn't able to. Inside the house we wipe down our groceries before putting them away. Go Lysol wipes!!"
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,2/3/2021,Post_Covid,N,5,,"We use this on everything, from toilet to kitchen, from countertop to flooring. There are many similar products out there, but this is the one we like the most. The wipes are strong, and durable; it can cover quite a bit of area and take quite some abuse. This pack of 4 is good price too."
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,3/5/2021,Post_Covid,Sara Rivera,1,,When I opened the box I knew something was wrong because the plastic wrapped around the wipes was wet. I opened the plastic wrap and the labels were all wet and the solution was leaking out. Some of the towels were dry and one had all brown stuff in the middle of the wipes. I‚Äôm so disappointed. What a waste of money!!
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,12/2/2020,Post_Covid,Jacqueline,1,,"When I opened the package I could feel a liquid dripping. The containers were slightly open so it leaked. Needless to say the wipes are pretty dry, the scent wasn‚Äôt very strong... this was the first time I was able to find wipes sink was really excited about it so I‚Äôm really bummed out right now..."
disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,3/15/2021,Post_Covid,Kat,2,,When I removed wrapping items had leaked.  Wipes were not as wet as usual. Probably will be dried out before I use these 4 large canisters. There is no extra wetness in bottom of canister as there usually is. ( usually have some left after wipes are all used).  Would return them but have thrown out original box.

disinfecting_wipes,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q70RCW6,5/28/2020,Post_Covid,Desiree,3,2,"When I was able to order these sanitizing wipes online I felt like I won the lottery during this pandemic (Covid-19).  They arrived in their usual sealed packaging (it‚Äôs a 4-pack) in a typical shipping box.  For whatever reason, the Lysol company no longer had a seal on the tops of the individual containers of wipes and once I opened the sealed packaging there was liquid all throughout.  As I am in desperate need of wipes, I found 3 of the containers leaked only a little bit, while the 4th is quite dry.  I am keeping them but will continue to search for them in a store rather than ship them."
